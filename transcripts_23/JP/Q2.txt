jim mitchell seaport global securities may proceed jim mitchell analyst seaport global securities llc q thanks good morning hey jeremy talked nii guidance clearly fed funds futures makes sense maybe guess first could kind discuss guess comment deposit behavior broadly around betas mix youre seeing far seems coming little better expected secondly probably importantly help us think implications higherforlonger rates outlook nii next year beyond guess intermediate term outlook guys talked jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure thanks jim yeah talk drivers upward revision said higher rates coupled lower deposit reprice hard untangle two drivers specifically think look consumer combination passage time positive feedback getting field cd offerings particular meant quite kind stable environment perspective similarly wholesale seeing slower internal migrations asked mix think obviously seeing cd mix increase would expect continue take place probably even past peak rate cycle next year continue capture money motion say important point fact said earlier dont consider level nii generation sustainable talked previously sort mediumterm run rate mids first republic could argue maybe number little higher whatever lot lower current number dont know thats going happen going predict exact moment thats going function competitive dynamics marketplace want clear expect point jim mitchell analyst seaport global securities llc q okay guess one followup dont get rate cuts till middle next year later sort give confidence outlook next year still worried significant reprice jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co wouldnt necessarily assume evolution current run rate mids number sensitive rate outlook particular put number looked range different types rate environments reprice think would associated really meant capture consider throughthecycle sustainable number wouldnt think particularly ratedependent jim mitchell analyst seaport global securities llc q okay great thanks operator next well go line erika najarian ubs may proceed erika najarian analyst ubs securities llc q hi good morning jeremy im laughing said investor day nii rabbits pull hat guess guess want ask broader question really maybe jamie id like get thoughts earned rotce cet hear loud clear youre normalized nii generation billion said fully taking account

natural sort bottom fed funds going zero input would great jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks erika mean good question theres lot obviously guess would start saying talked throughthecycle rotce even though may introduced moment lower zero bound always premised sort normalized rate environment level remains true today furthermore didnt ask explicitly context proposed basel iii endgame one relevant question might lot capital denominator happens target think said prepared remarks feel confident companys ability produce excellent returns cycle theres lot moving parts right could good could bad narrowly capital one one thing point straightup math simply diluting rotce expanding denominator misses possibility reprice repricing products services course goes back point capital increases impacts real economy suggesting price way obviously need get right returns products services pricing power adjust higher capital lot moving parts think important point range scenarios feel good ability deliver good results well see mix various factors plays especially see basel iii proposal go comment period jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co erika would add one thing mix businesses earn like rotce capitalintensive look kind think good number good target thing overearning credit weve overearning credit substantial amount time quite conscious know going pick normalizes considerably look would consider credit card normalizing closer erika najarian analyst ubs securities llc q followup question maybe jeremy could remind us unemployment rate embedded acl ratio second quarter jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah still erika najarian analyst ubs securities llc q thank operator next well go line

might lead start try planning seem like time real actually going get proposal presumably sometime month something soon enough well get see something actually paper stop kind guesswork said indulging little bit guesswork seem like biggest single driver increase people talking including chair powells number vice chair barrs rwa winds roughly way operational risk getting introduced standardized pillar little bit straightup acrosstheboard tax everything kind hard optimize way exception obviously fact simply increase price assuming pricing power thats obviously want thats sort mean impacts real economy details lot frtb stuff get way weeds within markets business good track record adjusting optimizing time around may fundamental set questions around business mix opposed ability sort optimize technical way john mcdonald analyst autonomous research q okay thats helpful number years phase generating capital high level even rotce comes bit think pace building capital new changes versus everyday course investing buybacks things like next couple years jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mean guess im sort tempted give standard capital hierarchy mean going sacrifice investments right wont come surprise generally speaking always going try comply new requirements early know requirements visibility obviously given much organic capital generating right whatever answer winds itll pretty easy comply narrowly speaking thats saying wont consequences returns pricing whatever reason things arent exactly anticipating dont see us sacrificing investments see strategically critical order comply higher capital requirements ahead formal timing whatever john mcdonald analyst autonomous research q okay theres room buybacks jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co unlikely obviously would unlikely outcome john mcdonald analyst autonomous research q okay thank jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sorry john go ahead followup john mcdonald analyst autonomous research q yeah buybacks play role next couple years strategically episodically buy back jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co mean capital hierarchy right end nothing else money well buybacks talked billion year obviously lot new moving parts although else equal given weve done far thats still probably reasonable number full year yeah thats always going end list yeah john mcdonald analyst autonomous research q got okay thank operator next well go line ken usdin jefferies may proceed ken usdin analyst jefferies llc q thanks good morning wanted ask little bit youre feeling tradeoff like commercial economy might come terms future loan growth versus kind green shoots people talking investment banking pipeline feels terms like reopening markets tradeoff getting fees versus whats happening loan demand side thanks jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure good question ken think terms investment banking markets yeah slightly better expected last month would talk green shoots especially capital markets generally still definitely headwinds lower announced activity regulatory headwinds well see think little early call trend based recent results well see terms broader economy loan growth expectations generally still expect reasonably robust card loan growth away variety different reasons different products whether mortgage ci revolver normalization especially see little bit cooling economy would expect loan demand relatively modest really expecting meaningful growth away card course right deals right products right terms lend cycle see demanddriven narrative function economy rather tightening side ken usdin analyst jefferies llc q makes sense followup consumer side mentioned consumers continue spend albeit little slowly mentioned consumers also using excess deposits little bit well elaborate little bit feeling state consumer card growth continue driven people needing revolve opposed wanting deposits kind want tradeoff side jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mean us think still see normalization deterioration story talk consumer credit actually revolve per account still gotten prepandemic levels actually would definitely say wanting rather needing least portfolio point yeah think consumer continues surprise upside ken usdin analyst jefferies llc q got okay thank operator next well go line gerard cassidy rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy analyst rbc capital markets llc q good morning jeremy good morning jamie jeremy give us view youre measuring treasury functions asset liability balance sheet go forward versus way guys positioning managing year ago view fact looks like maybe approaching terminal rate fed funds rates jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah gerard would say honestly much changed actually pretty consistently concerned risk higher rates course always try position things produce reasonable outcomes across broad range scenarios margin weve biased towards higher rates may little less true levels although lot consequence deposit convexity playing modeling case else equal think going continue focus making sure fine higher rate scenario staying balanced across range scenarios really lot change positioning thats obviously including fact took first republic even net liabilities long structural interest rate position actually want get longer part deal result took actions ensure netnet still last quarter gerard cassidy analyst rbc capital markets llc q good followup mentioned giving us readthrough commercial banking segment business reserve building tied office real estate also downgrades middle market area go little deeper guys seeing area commercial real estate also ci loans whats happening segment well jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah would caution drawing broad conclusion mean think talk office example portfolio know quite small exposure sort socalled urban dense office even smaller vast majority overall portfolio multifamily lending result like sample size observed valuations office properties quite small know like sort ahead cycle based everything saw quarter felt reasonable build little bit get felt like comfortable coverage ratio middle market segment saw downgrades excess upgrades dont see sort necessarily indicative anything terribly significant broader readacross gerard cassidy analyst rbc capital markets llc q thank operator next well go line steve chubak wolfe research please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co steve operator looks like line dropped next well go line ebrahim poonawala bank america may proceed ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch q good morning guess first question following outlook economy like weve worried recession year theres debate lagged effects fed rate hike cycle think jeremy think mentioned unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus quarter ago worried terms credit cycle months leaning towards concluding maybe us businesses consumers absorbed rate cycle lot better expected year ago jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mean im sure jamie views view would caution jumping many superpositive conclusions based couple recent prints think generally point less trying predict particular outcome trying make sure dont get much euphoria overconcentrates people one particular prediction know theres range outcomes obviously people talking lot potential softlanding right landing immaculate disinflation whatever whether views changed meaningfully dont know broader point continue quite focused jamies prior comment loss rates still room normalize even postpandemic probably overearning credit little bit obviously weve talked expectation nii going come quite bit even forgetting whether get surprisingly negative outcomes economy stand today even central case need recognize significant normalization jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah would add prediction average unemployment multiple scenarios use hypothetical cecl prediction thats going always look something different dont know outcome try really clear consumer good shape theyre spending excess cash thats tailwinds even go recession theyre going rather good conditions low borrowings good house price values still headwinds substantial somewhat unprecedented theres war ukraine oil gas quantitative tightening unprecedented fiscal needs governments qt never experienced think people take deep breath dont know things could put us soft landing mild recession hard recession obviously hope best ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch q got followup upcoming basel reforms two questions youve talked impact us economy like others said point falling deaf ears secondly maybe jeremy touch upon structural changes expect make capital markets business frtb thank jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah first point mean think read vice chair barrs speech right ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch q yeah jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co addressed point fairly directly clearly doesnt agree right well see happens continue feel else equal higher capital requirements definitely going increase cost credit bad economy well see happens frtb really nuanced probably much detail call honest give like one immaterial insignificant useful example one product frtb yield curve spread options frtb proposal goes currently written product becomes viable obviously need stop product one really cares one example way sometimes youre really disciplined allocating capital thoroughly way individual products responding accordingly wind change business mix obviously significant products matter much real economy like mortgage layeringon operational risk way proposed especially beneficial elements proposal dont come youre making product even harder offer homeowners well see well see happens jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co would add even product doesnt make money might clients great clients youre going manage product client effectively business mix need adjustments roughly loans dont make sense put balance sheet whole almost loan people recognize manage various complications figure hell ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch q okay thank operator next well go line mike mayo wells fargo securities may proceed mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc q hi another question vice chair barrs speech week extent capital ratios go perhaps others degree would think changing business model terms remixing business repricing simply removing activities used kind ironic maybe ironic apollo hits alltime stock price high week speech much business leaves jpmorgan industry capital ratios go much potentially proposed jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mike mean jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co wait jeremy answers question great news hedge funds private equity private credit apollo blackstone theyre dancing streets jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah exactly going say mike yes everything meaning repricing yes definitely extent pricing power higher capital requirements mean generating right returns shareholders try reprice well see sticks flows economy affects demand products repricing successful cases remix means getting certain products services jamie points probably means products services leave regulated perimeter go elsewhere thats fine jamie points people clients think point addressed also vice chair barrs speech traditionally risky activities leave regulated perimeter negative consequences important things consider mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc q alright separate question appreciate investor day gives little bit color degree investments may may pan still watching closely said increased revenue guidance billion nii quarter first quarter without changing expense guidance even arent tempted spend little bit spend youre gaining share im saying im wondering like arent tempted billion revenues youre spending expenses like jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co mike let get right youre actually complaining expenses arent high enough right mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc q wait wait clear flip side question asked two years going back jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co fair enough appreciate balance seriousness weve always pretty clear right spending throughthecycle spending based throughthecycle investment throughthecycle spending based throughthecycle view earningsgenerating power company goal produce right returns broadly speaking nii tends flow straight bottom line going way going weve moments well remember whether opportunities deploy dollars marketing stuff like actually looked recently dont see meaningful item year part revised expense guidance far investing cycle honest disciplined revenue items carry expense loading dont mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc q last quick followup jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co mike think kind running fast actually sat directly credit compliance auto market bankers recruiters traders mike full effort right want make sure get things right get things thoughtful careful money people many things change add mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc q one quick followup efficiency ratio quarter lowest weve seen long long time guess youre saying dont extrapolate efficiency ratio nii come point simply look benchmark lowcost providers think youre still go extrapolate quarter youre getting closer jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mean said right definitely extrapolate current numbers think broadly benchmarking lowcost providers sort speaks area youve interested long time investment technology improve generally scalability get cost base variable versus fixed terms respond volumes thats big part reason investments modernization cloud ai type stuff weve talked lot think feel really good efficiency company definitely room improvement mike mayo analyst wells fargo securities llc q alright thank operator next well go line steven chubak wolfe research may proceed steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc q hey thanks taking question apologies technical issues earlier wanted ask deposit outlook signs recent liquidity drawdown come predominantly rrp versus industry deposits wanted get thoughts expectations deposit growth second half even broader industry especially treasury issuance really begins ramp earnest jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question steve let say couple things obviously deposit numbers bounced around little bit function turmoil saw regional banks well obviously first republic transaction look kind endofperiod deposits quarter project forward core view would expect sort modest downward trend reassert higher starting point broadly function qt playing system noting hope offsets taking share give couple examples like consumer weve got branch expansion markets seasoning share opportunities wholesale weve obviously invested lot products services think compelling offerings helping us win mandates potentially share offsets broadly core view remains modest deposit declines across franchise within note thing weve noted got debt ceiling tga build come effect youve seen lot bill issuance big question market whether going come reserves come rrp far tga build guess theyre targeting billion theyre billion something theyre almost done people feared come rrp say think thats relatively good sign highlights system works better youve got ample supply shortdated collateral front end yield curve whole rrptga bank reserve dynamic going continue significant good see rrp coming little bit steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc q helpful color followup card income revenues muted quarter hoping could unpack sources pressure maybe specifically much drag associated fas versus factors jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah actually card income number steve little bit oneoff thing reward liability adjustment quarter kind technical thing thats temporary headwind also sequential comparison also getting hurt small positive oneoff item prior period obviously know guys looked card income isnt sort thing look much steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc q size reward liability impact jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co dont get mikael give significant enough make sequential number look little bit wonky steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc q great thanks taking questions operator next well go line glenn schorr evercore isi may proceed glenn schorr analyst evercore isi q thank want followup pricing power conversation youve consistent time limited ability sustain pricing power due competitive landscape guess question meaning lot changed institutional side european bank side regional bank side would think thered certain businesses greater ability willingness push price maybe could tie comments press release material realworld consequences markets end users youre referring talking material regulatory changes thanks lot jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure look pricing power youre right really depends product depends competitive landscape across different banks granular productspecific cases well pricing power cases think overall point trying make connection basel iii endgame like think capital increases excessive puts pressure returns else equal obviously puts pressure us increase price generally bad thing real economy plays detail across different products services remains seen importantly since dont actually proposal yet need details sorry glenn forgot second half question glenn schorr analyst evercore isi q actually think hit ill followup related notion private credit large traditional investmentgrade lending activity maybe part competitive landscape limits ability push price jamies letter talked downside question whats downside mortgage credit assetbacked intermediation business pushed banking system jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co mean guess depends mean downside think societally speaking think weve seen recent history home lending happening outside regulated perimeter things get bad economic downturns produces bad outcomes individuals homeowners society whole jamie written extensively beyond financially weve talked mortgage lending mean profitability swings obviously reasonably cyclical recent past actually profitable less like correspondent channel right actually picking little bit thinmargin business challenging increase capital requirements makes even harder becomes one areas youre tension remixing versus pricing power talked second ago might fact mean less less credit available homeowners regulatory risk activity moves outside perimeter glenn schorr analyst evercore isi q appreciate jeremy operator next well go line betsy graseck morgan stanley may proceed betsy l graseck analyst morgan stanley co llc q hi good morning jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy betsy l graseck analyst morgan stanley co llc q wanted unpack little bit

expect billion come deposit betas youre anticipating going accelerating im trying put two things together jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question quite technical issue think past way number constructed assume throughthe cycle betas deposits notion like number would include deposit beta acceleration would case wouldve using essentially terminal deposit betas based forward curve based shock forward curve nuance weve introduced recognize given shock reprice beta predicts instantaneous get sort mathematical consequences think translating statement expectation beta next months relative nii guide might bridge far im sure actually draw conclusion betsy l graseck analyst morgan stanley co llc q right saying earlier deposit betas anticipate going accelerating thats part outlook nii longerterm normalize mids right jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes let emphasize something go ahead jamie jamie dimon chairman chief

sheet principles would expect us jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co would add look top page press release trillion cash marketable securities even get excess going like forgot exact number trillion think excess liquidity liquidity ratio slightly something different think theres plenty liquidity system course multiple things change overnight wanted charles w peabody analyst portales partners llc q right sort wrapped followup take billion forecast nii year implies least one quarter maybe billion nii take eventual forecast mid billion nii point future would imply least one quarter billion nii thats drop hold balance sheet steady youre talking basis point charles w peabody analyst portales partners llc q drop margin nim get billion billion mean driving really deposit thinking terms interest reversals credit deteriorates rebuilding liquidity im trying get better sense impact jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah hey charlie would think really entirely deposit story complicated right think think either fourth quarter first quarter put little chart page simple terms shows dollar consequences whatever like basis point change deposit rate paid terms nii run rate whether consequence migration loweryielding higheryielding going cd obviously big impact margin whether savings reprices relatively small changes rate kind lot
