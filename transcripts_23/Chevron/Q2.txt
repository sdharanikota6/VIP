production market thailand benchamas one fpso thailand incident early year taken station thats another thousand barrels day net foreseeable future two things ones pushing us unexpected john royall great thanks mike next question sticking production drilling bit permian well results generally look strong first half still bit new mexico maybe update us inning think youre terms optimizing singlebench developments new mexico mike wirth thing think important bear mind new mexico type curve showed slide pops represented pops achieved second quarter firstquarter pops seven pops enough data make curve see chart thin set data expect new mexico pops second half year bulk program represented curves couple things new mexico wells pop facility constraints limited full productivity actually havent able move production due thirdparty facility constraints faced rest program different part new mexico portion delaware basin expect higher productivity combination things id caution overindex thin data set lot data come second half year operator thank well go next devin mcdermott morgan stanley devin mcdermott morgan stanley hey good morning thanks taking question pierre congrats retirement mike wirth devin still drilling primary benches optimize oil cut across permian basin production remains roughly oil ngls gas look commodities oil ngls gas longterm views prices markets run economics optimize returns wanted stick permian since topic wondering could talk little bit around mixed trend youre seeing disaggregate productivity little bit talk much uplift coming gas ngls versus oil similarly progress towards longerterm production goals expect mix basin trend oil gas ngls time gasoil ratio aggregate relatively flat number years dont see changing lot vary little bit different parts permian basin take whole permian portfolio oil ngls gas remains pretty good way think devin mcdermott great wanted shift tco good hear continued positive progress get closer finish line theres lot moving pieces next year year half get two phases development online give guidance turnaround impact q wondering youd talk little bit see evolution production fourth quarter year get run rate shape bit us look next quarters mike wirth headline change cost schedule think thats really important second quarter made really good progress said project completion commissioning essentially twothirds complete second quarter achieved mechanical completion gi gas injection facilities got fuel gas flare system important enable ontime startup fgp third quarter expect full mechanical completion future growth project also turnaround one complex technology lines ktls well begin lot work startup utility systems boilers steam system utilities required startup pressure boost facility key driver wpmp enables us convert highpressure lowpressure across field turnaround done third quarter see production impact pierre guided expect two four big pressure boost compressors online allows us begin conversion metering stations highpressure lowpressure well get started end year take months conversions occur next year two turnarounds next year well one sgi sour gas injection another one one ktls part carefully choreographed sequencing turnarounds startup activity bring full field million barrels day indicated investor day youre going see normal turnaround activity interlaced project startup activity simple bringing new portion field really reworking entire gathering producing capacity field quite complex series activities execute production reflects put cid chart give guidance year next year pierre breber slide cid slides annual production change guidance operator thank well go next neil mehta goldman sachs neil mehta goldman sachs good morning team pierre breber want stay tco volume inflection theres probably going prefree cash flow inflection affiliate capex rolls first talk cadence manifests terms dividends weve guiding neil clean year thats billion free cash flow brent guiding free cash flow recall dividends also repayment loans colending done along way profile loans disclosed sec filings point youll see build towards inflection point affiliate capex rolled long ago investing billion year share project thats billion year continue trend inflection point also managed commodity prices vary weve said tco continues conservative managing balance sheet holding cash balance sheet project gets closer end weve demonstrated cpc running reliably almost year half expect cash come cant get front board directors tco tco separate company shareholder expect weve said much bigger dividend fourth quarter saw q expect see release surplus cash thats held balance sheet continue next couple years head billion free cash flow guidance last thing neil know know tco really good price sensitivities ive seen estimates brent cash flow even stronger neil mehta thanks pierre great followup return capital think big buyback range lot market participants viewed billion annual rate p outcome reasonable commodity price environment thinking less like flywheel relatively fixed number unless commodity prices go wacky thoughts statement whether youre trying give us little bit assurance around number opposed volatile number pierre breber range neil tied upside downside cases showed investor day roughly theres billion range youre right wide range reflects wide range commodity prices upside case downside case theres midcycle case reminder downside case gets brent couple years stays three years real downside case thats low end buyback range notionally tied upside case case thats different seeing averages brent fiveyear period trends brent towards end period thats youre seeing buyback close top end range billion annual rate certainly signal look commodity cycle think buybacks steady across cycle feel good weve said could much larger buyback would steady dont want procyclical trying across cycle guide buybacks guiding intent maintaining number years across cycle mike wirth

facilities theres length weighed margins olefins chain short term think going continue see would pretty tough sector longer term get middecade beyond demand continue grow expect demand supply come better balance well see margins recover towards middle second part decade second question certainly weve seen refining margins come strong levels last year theres new capacity come system around world big new refineries begun startup major projects come online margins softened year year certainly west coast portfolio important west coast margins refining marketing part value chain held little bit better market little bit cut rest world gulf coast asia demand continues pretty strong gasoline demand strong jet demand continues come back diesel demand maybe flattened little bit certainly holding
