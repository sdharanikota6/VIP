presumably nonop side nice contribution q could give clarity bridge sort q q market concerned hitting numbers least year recently mike wirth third quarter nonop little light fourth quarter came back nonop royalty right guided beginning year year quarterly ups downs things create questions nonop growth came right guided midteens story fourth quarter really strong execution pops faster drilling faster cycle time completions shorter cycle time frac pop increased noted continue build duc inventory drilling performance strong couple things pops fourth quarter weighted towards new mexico guided towards activity would lead pops new mexico second half year wells productive average rest portfolio flows final thing would point higher reliability youll recall third quarter talked little bit midstream constraints things werent related completions pops anything else constraints flow fewer frac hits fewer schedule delays weather downtime midstream issues quarter contributed strong

think first theres lot stuff thats running new wells producing right infrastructure terms utility power distribution control center running thats keeping plants full saw really strong performance last year mentioned strongest four years fourth strongest history field seeing good deliverability new wells key thing production year keeping plants full begin convert field pushing highpressure plant lower back pressure field improves deliverability wells allows us extend life field get one million barrels day begin converting metering stations take production metering station producing low pressure well boost back get existing plant get converted pressure boost compressors online well get whole field producing lower back pressure gives us lot excess well capacity ensures going keep plant full bring new process equipment start route lowpressure production plant run lower pressure thats really kind high level description trying convey weve got legend shows certain things going begin startup various quarters fgp focused commissioning major equipment allow us bring plant take us one million barrels day transferring learnings compressors pumps things working walking critical substations well continue provide updates key milestones fourth quarter talking couple gas turbine generators online first quarter inlet separator ready operation well commission sweet fluids prepare sour production said second quarter begin pbf startup metering station conversions track guidance continue provide detail move forward quarter specific milestones progress operator well go next doug

capital wound weve said get incremental production fgp goes even higher puts takes tco held surplus cash released last year year theyre going build cash head debt payments recall colent well receiving timing variation point around trajectory absolutely right capex winding largely selffunded affiliate company capex goes theres cash available depend commodity price assumptions youre right lng also petchem major drivers little bit refining affiliate dividends roughly flat prior year well update go along year tco weve investing project eight years going generate lot cash comes next year sam one

slides highlight optimized well spacing maybe coring drilling helped well productivity analyst day talked technologies im curious improvements saw related part b quickly youre growing almost barrels next two years last quarter infrastructure issues get ahead infrastructure issues dont resurface time period mike wirth technology referenced fact drilling feet rig fleet improving completions lot small things contributing performance seeing right improved recovery technologies various stages piloted field extent pilots production contribute would say margin gathering field data look changes completion fracture techniques using gas injection gas lift different ways using different chemicals improve flow get largescale deployment well start talk well help understand theyre contributing right drilling completions cycle time side seeing improvements theres come midstream infrastructure issues weve talked weatherrelated related regulatory items related particular gas processing plant gathering offtake pipeline system working point well made large producing asset scale need really really reliable performance downstream wells constraints takeaway capacity basin well positioned ultimate takeaway capacity access market lot pipes pumps tanks things field market things need perform high priority operations team field mentioned fourth quarter performance strong theyre high priority saw little bit weather january pierre guided modest impact confident weve got line sight operational priorities order ensure market access isnt constrained operator well go next devin mcdermott morgan stanley devin mcdermott morgan stanley thanks taking question pierre want echo congrats thanks help years wanted circle back tco mike think last quarter provided updated guidance

ensure theyve properly inspected refer punch list items identified work still needs completed contractors get loop checks equipment runs work bring pieces equipment service weve got number contractors working weve moved scope contractors lower productivity exhibited higher productivity weve brought additional resources beef overall capacity resources contractors lower productivity weve worked understand constraints bottlenecks weve seen one productivity factor measure range previously targeting get similar quantum theres lot work ground sure got right people working right things enough contract resources also bringing technical resources discover items need technical solutions include company people vendor people much ahead last quarter quarter walk downs identification issues short

permitting done sure youve got right tools equipment et cetera great big project devin largest brownfield project complex brownfield project ive seen life seeing good improvements terms ontheground performance team contractor teams working operator well take next question jason gabelman td cowen jason gabelman td cowen want echo everyones comments pierre great working good luck retirement wanted go back permian basin appreciate type curve data provided back slide deck bit difficult reconcile type curves provided particularly delaware capital markets day forecasted large improvement productivity talk type curves particularly delaware basin ended line anticipated shown capital markets day type curve mike wirth ill quickly touch midland basin continue first quartile performer steady consistent performance understand geology theres less fluid complexity top quartile first quartile performer midland last year showed actual data delawarewide basis showed forward guidance particularly focused new mexico shifting much program new mexico mentioned earlier productive portion basin delawarenew mexico saw significant improvement second half pops last year pops second half productive areas subsurface performance strong appendix weve got slide shows pops second half see lay right type curve see improvement delaware basintexas didnt guide last year combined chart weve seen strong improvement weve updated well spacing completion designs within basin subbasins performing exceptionally strong well seeing performance consistent outlined investor day last year think shift basis provide little bit detail subbasins well continue report basis going forward pierre breber reminder jason last years performance new mexico wasnt impacted longsitting ducs yearonyear bang consistent cid guidance see improvement texas impact longsitting ducs prior year operator well take next question jeoffrey lambujon tph co jeoffrey lambujon tph co morning everyone thanks taking question wanted follow actually permian specifically ask program year kind opportunity see improvements spacing completion design cycle times texas delaware region could whats working well translate new mexico make wells even stronger quicker drill complete even midland side secondly thinking mix capital allocation across regions within permian throughout year mike wirth constantly looking learn improve mentioned earlier weve seen significant improvements drilling time completion time pop year lot little things right continue things find efficiencies bring technology bear et cetera look extend learnings across basin frankly basins dj basin dj basin permian differences subbasins understand respect short answer yes looking ways transfer learnings across every time think probably plateau terms productivity improvement smart people find ways continue get even better dont think weve seen end performance improvement cycle overall capital allocation basin largely function portfolio lies midland basin delawarenew mexico portion basin balance delawaretexas way past year going forward thats pretty good way approximate operator well go next john royall jp morgan john royall jp morgan hi good morning thanks congratulations pierre im going give guys break tco permian im going ask question dj looking growth kbd think growth pro forma basis trying understand whats kind underlying real growth rate dj could update us couple quarters behind postpdce broader plans development dj mike wirth fourth quarter first full quarter pdc third quarter two months three pdc see came fourth quarter little bit barrels day plans hold dj around barrels day going forward highly efficient factory fourth quarter maybe even little stronger might expected wasnt much weatherrelated downtime november december accounting adjustments booked fourth quarter really related operations thousand barrels day theres things contributing probably repeating going pull back little bit confident hold around barrels day still executing well design well spacing pdc basis design little bit different wells tighter spacing driven drive volume basis design focused return invested capital wider spacing bigger fracs less capital overall higher returns transition standardized basis design across basin youll see roll numbers weve got four rigs going weve got permits multiple years nearly end decade pleased learning things theres stuff weve learned pdc apply rest dj going apply permian well thats going help us going forward high cash margin low breakeven barrels plan hold plateau around thousand barrels day synergies track weve got virtually capex synergies essentially bag already billion opex synergy close million guided seeing procurement synergies hadnt originally envisioned everything better guided operator well go next lucas herrmann bnp paribas lucas herrmann bnp paribas pierre ill add comments host already thank insights always worth listening look growth youre likely see oil particular next two three years feels though youre going adding towards million maybe slightly barrels pretty highmargin black oil question whiplash increased sensitivity business going movements volatile commodity feel pierre might imply balance sheet way think balance sheet managing things could add could give idea loan repayment schedule looks like tco presume loan repayments go net net line capex side investment side equation play elsewhere thank pierre breber right thanks lucas ill take weve overweight upstream overweight oil liquids long time youre right recent acquisitions hess certainly adds like exposure terms manage balance sheet first thing start breakeven oil price takes cover capex dividends low last year see mostly upside thats record share buybacks last year almost billion shares outstanding built price well currently weve also done maintaining strong balance sheet net debt ratio said keep share repurchases steady across cycle okay relevering back towards low end guidance range guidance kind cycle net debt ratio guidance still holds significant change portfolio course would look eimear would look going forward think actions taking consistent guidance think balance sheet take account lots things portfolio commodity price outlook breakeven really key mike talking capital cost discipline ability fund reinvestment program traditional new energies grow company pay growing dividend twice nearest peer greater sp increased numbers latest increase low price return surplus cash thats going think expect net debt increase time depending commodity prices return cash shareholders exposure highmargin barrels say thats good thing built long keep breakeven low prices trading really good spot mike wirth tco loan payments flow cash flow pierre breber oh yeah sorry yes alluded cash ops shows investing cash jake team take saying affiliate line flipping thats separate different line see cash returned billion share next year billion billion thats disclosed k jake take shouldnt surprised weve investing eight years project cash going come back project startsup operator well take next question irene himona socit gnrale irene himona socit gnrale thank much pierre best next chapter question henry hub new sensitivities published today saw material increase henry hub sensitivity purely pdc related macro level perhaps share views outlook henry hub please pierre breber ill start irene mike take macro yes function pdc certainly associated gas comes along permian growing comes along natural gas mike wirth broadly speaking oil markets pretty balanced right think geopolitics thing harder call could drive movements one way could opec decisions conflict middle east economic growth world continues decent outlook demand growth year maybe quite strong last year still growing gas little bit different inventories high us inventories high europe kind mostly wintertime certainly riskiest period wintertime theres questions going really weigh market near term maybe longer term exports us got gas markets little pressure oil markets refined products unusual pierre talking built company compete cycles petrochemicals pressure right well point time going find fundamentals probably pressure others looking pretty good short term think henry hub pressure category operator well go next bob brackett bernstein research bob brackett bernstein research good morning look production guide growth say million try book end fourth quarter closer going see tco fgp start plus hitting millionbarrel day milestone permian sort implies theres inflection point production growth coming point perhaps theres conservative guide year right way think mike wirth coming year full year pdc thatll part portfolio thats pretty safe terms counting ive already mentioned fourth quarter little bit higher maybe even might expected high reliability midstream issues faced permian didnt repeat accounting catch thing permian well pretty light turnaround schedule fourth quarter strong quarter way around head next year weve got asset sales guidance bob weve kind ended last couple years hitting guidance range low end think could probably think would little comfortably middle range year given number things mentioned try give guidance year expect hit certainly expect hit year operator well take last question neal dingmann truist securities neal dingmann truist securities mike maybe shareholder return specifically sounds like want get sense youll continue paying majority free cash flow remainder year buybacks continue constitute bit payout mike wirth neal used percentage range percentage cash operations kind go buy distributions weve done leaned track record dividend first weve already clarified expect year increase weve announced would point back towards upside downside guidance weve number years billion billion range buybacks upside price case wed towards higher end lower price case lower end comfortably handle indicated post hess close things equal well see happens world looks get would expect move rate billion top end billion confident longterm cash productive capacity portfolio strength balance sheet rather focusing percentages id really point towards specific guidance weve issued kind track record course think pierre mentioned comments remain sec restrictions right relative rate buy back market hess proxy open normal times dont one constraints us pierre breber would add little bit fitting last words share buybacks six straight years buybacks past years actually bought back shares last year year even though earnings cash flow higher records still strong thats whole point trying steady across commodity cycle weve heard investors buybacks procyclical hard countercyclical commodity business price volatility steady across cycle guide formulas fact reinforce opposite reinforce procyclicality giving return ways almost independent prices within range could paid held back used pay well see goes intent try steady across cycle neither procyclical countercyclical jake spiering thank would like thank everyone time today appreciate interest chevron participation todays call
