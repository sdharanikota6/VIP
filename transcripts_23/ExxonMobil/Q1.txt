marginal barrel refining comes europe europe price setter global markets extransportation weve got high gas prices europe think potential go higher youve got high carbon prices europe marginal tier production lot expensive historically thats going keep think pressure higher prices globe therefore better margins youre producing outside europe neil mehta okay darren thanks much darren woods bet
