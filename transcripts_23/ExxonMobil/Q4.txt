might involve near term darren woods yes sure rightly pointed proprietary nature limit details talking maybe broader context standpoint convinced carbon capture going play really important role helping society meet ambitions get net zero make certainly significant reductions carbon emissions think makes lot sense rather tear throw away existing infrastructure industries place intensive energy users find way deal problem emissions think carbon capture plays role technology date frankly wasnt developed application use deployed today high concentration streams move emissions profile get lower lower concentrations co streams existing technology challenged becomes expensive every ton carbon reduce challenge use existing technology today high concentrations streams make economics excerpt exxonmobil q earnings call work find lower cost method deploy less concentrated streams still make economic thats challenge working recognizing existing technology designed different purpose need new technology trying take advantage material science development things happened materials nanostructures theres lot advances technology since existing technology developed theres question better capture co using advances existing technology think weve come opportunity potentially early days like technology developments built pilot plant well see test new capabilities test cost effectiveness capture would say first step looking get cost reduction half would tell thats still enough see significant step change cost path cost reduction gives us hope continue advance get something competitive economic deploy across world crack ive said many times holy grail addressing emissions direct air capture challenge industry find ways cost effectively frankly early stages technology technology development whether successful somebody else successful feel like area worth exploring think technology companies got great ideas know scale things know optimize materials
