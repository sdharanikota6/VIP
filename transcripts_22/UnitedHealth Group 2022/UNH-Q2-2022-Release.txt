Adjusted net earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or
superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the
Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful
information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s
acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from
period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related
revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.
