biraj borkhataria rbc biraj borkhataria hi thanks taking questions two things first one comments darren runaway inflation obviously permian gets lot headlines wondering could talk little bit offshore environment exxonmobil one active space want get sense youre seeing inflation wise offshore second question capex probably shouldnt take q numbers annualize would guide obviously adjust little bit seasonality would thought youd adding growth capex versus plus inflationary pressure mentioned much contingency capex guidance risks upside downside thank darren woods good morning biraj let start last question move first respect capex look range weve given think weve indicated comments made well upper end range consistent slight increase given work would reiterate broader range weve given years continues fit well plans consistent pacing established came pandemic mentioned worked contractors lay plan continue progress investments would tell today projects organization feel really good progress making efficiencies gaining capex look pause take due pandemic basically offset costs maintain level productivity spend going forward something real proud projects organization would expect continue stay within range changes obviously years come well update plans develop make sure stay aware respect inflation would say operating expense standpoint one point id make look organization year year essentially synergies capturing scale advantages purchasing power essentially businesses collectively came plan able offset inflation seeing expense standpoint obviously easy task look different projects around world really function chose engage contractors engage equipment using mean look permian short cycle theres lot activity like lot parts business supply demand gets tight puts pressure pricing theres less supply demand pressure parts business seeing kind pressure seeing permian tends one area thats really really hot think areas using size business longterm plans longterm commitments make contracting partners make sure keeping check partners playing long game us think weve done pretty good job keeping capital productivity pretty high feel pretty good dont know kathy anything want add kathy mikells thing would add id really caution taking fourthquarter capex exploration expense annualizing tend run bit higher fourth quarter expense isnt prorated year overall came right expected talked corporate plan december said expect billion billion expected see little bit increase year year part payara pulled forward little spending china starting spool obviously emission plans also spooling right id say consistent expectations guidance weve given biraj borkhataria okay thank color darren woods sure operator well go next jeanine wai barclays jeanine wai hi good morning thanks taking question darren woods good morning jeanine kathy mikells good morning jeanine wai good morning kathy good morning darren question downstream nice positive think eu embargo russian product imports february th impact refining margins guess thinking theres number moving pieces refining footprint particularly gulf coast europe theres potential tailwinds diesel margins russian export dissipate theres also probably need take account likely incremental tightness vgo supplies thank darren woods yeah ill take jeanine think ill start market general think driver behind refining margins weve seen late driven pandemic impacts shutting capacity capacity available demand recovered world remains pretty tight stay think tight wait additional refinery expansions come online primarily asia middle east think russia impact ban products going europe could potentially shortterm implications end day products going needed really around logistics ill call disoptimization market pretty efficient weve got efficient supply chains logistics systems lined going disrupt think question disruption manifest market kind disconnects discontinuities see short term ultimately system stabilize reoptimize expect higher cost youre moving less optimal logistics approach stable see thats going play dont think therell longterm impact shortterm one question long takes system rebalance think fundamental refining shortness economies picking china coming covid lockdown economic growth view take economic impacts severe recessions year thats probably going play much bigger role demand picks economies continue grow going see tightness manifest continued highrefining margins think mean fairly high margins year potentially going well jeanine wai okay appreciate color thank darren woods sure operator well go next neil mehta goldman sachs neil mehta yeah thank darren kathy wanted spend time permian outlook made comments prepared remarks getting barrels day guess thats growth think thoughts volumes ultimately think plateau darren woods yeah thanks neil would take back talking strategy permian said time plan grow million barrels day production pandemic hit basically said theres going delay lot plans pushed objectives two years moving look comments plans forecasting permian production reach million barrels day much line going way back comments made around pandemic delay introduced think thats context think permian development look added barrels day production similar number barrels day part id call organic development drilling production well clearing ducs inventory pandemic obviously lot incentive bring production concentrated spend drilling got higherpriced environments concentrated clearing inventory bringing wells production bringing duc inventory go next year going rebuild inventory get optimum level use maintain go next several years thats strategy working think ultimately getting million barrels day thats roughly compounded annual growth rate thats going steady every year kind fluctuate call plus minus thats order magnitude well see playing one years production function development plans development plans manifest specific timeframe think bottomline basically plan moving pace anticipated im hopeful continue focus technology developments continuing improve efficiency well see either production brought online effectively lower cost fact productivity higher production thats function ongoing work weve got bring technology operational capabilities bear permian continue improve operator well go next devin mcdermott morgan stanley devin mcdermott good morning thanks taking question darren woods good morning devin mcdermott going ask chemicals business look margin chart slide deck one part portfolio margins still year range wondering could talk little bit trends youre seeing move early china reopening potentially positive driver margins also talk discrete growth projects youve got coming next years drive earnings growth talked investor day last year think baytown starting later year get china chemicals complex still years growth projects progress well darren woods yeah sure think maybe take sides equation chemicals ill start demand side equation referenced youre right think one things saw last year china lockdowns lack growth china big know chemical market impact demand side equation expectation move year china economy continues open well see demand pick back function whether deep widespread recessions around world thats going impact current conventions thinking holds recessions milder people anticipated think see benefit chemical demand side well supply side big part whats suppressing margins today came went pandemic lot chemical projects got put hold deferred investments youre seeing came pandemic look margins strong chemical margins saw investments get leaned lot capacity coming online weve got large capacity additions coming time weve demand slowdown think seeing play would say typical supply demand swings commodity cycle exacerbated somewhat effects pandemic still playing inconsistent anticipated coming pandemic take little time demand pick fill capacity get back growth trajectory markets

impact doesnt really hit took overall accrual payments end occurring depends individual countries take overall step back say looked happened eu said legal opposite needed whats needed right supply instead whats put place penalty broad energy sector id contrast whats happened recently united states inflation reduction act see policy thats put incent industry accelerate technology accelerate investment thats greatly needed especially areas industries terms lowering emissions still pretty nascent things like hydrogen ccs youre already seeing investments start flow industries darren woods would add doug think obviously weve engaged governments throughout europe think sensitivity impact future investments industrys appetite continue invest challenging market environment first place respect europe becoming uncertain less stable think concern going suspicion many industry yet another reason pull back investments europe im sure youre going see begin propagate around world negative

appreciate perspective guys thanks much darren woods bet operator well go next alastair syme citi alastair syme thanks much darren kathy darren make highlevel comments competitive landscape see across business know broad question upstream energy products low carbon solutions see competitors behavior darren woods sure yeah obviously real important focus area us let maybe start broad strategy philosophy youve seen us executing last five years mentioned cnbc morning think see paying respect profit margins improvements seeing profit margins look higher revenues weve got today made money year less revenues thats really function improvement net profit margin went net profit margin think reflection work weve better position competitively go sectors ill start upstream emphasis really making

upgrade fill transition performance products strategy continues play well continuing see lot pull performance products thats strategy continue invest highend highvalue product slate chemical business refining really around evolving yield products make plants think contrary maybe conventional wisdom actually think refineries investing position us well uncertain future continuing make products society needs today across diversified slate products think chemicals fuels products lubricants time investing produce lowemissions fuels address lowcarbon demand piece market picks weve got really good competitively advantaged base shift production see us strathcona project one example many many concepts mind transition refinery production line demand evolution really function pacing think advantage versus rest competition big refining footprint thats going needed advantaged making lowemissions fuel think well positioned chemical business well positioned technology performance products making think weve got leg space finally low carbon solutions theres lot activity space lot interest particularly ira us generally around world think real focus low carbon opportunities think well positioned game startups large worldscale projects require kind project expertise require size balance sheet capacity requires technology operating experience theres lot id say skills capabilities

first one kathy couple items think impacted q earnings highlighted last earnings call downstream trading benefits particularly strong q wondering continued fourth quarter also highlighted k q earnings inventory impacts would headwind hoping could quantify well thanks kathy mikells yeah obviously third quarter quantified number favorable timing impacts didnt necessarily think going repeat think energy products performance quarter think absence positives overall last quarter right look quarterly basis overall third quarter fourth quarter energy products unsettled derivatives billion headwind thats really absence largely positive would third quarter third quarter talked fact program associated achieving ratable pricing refinery runs given us ill call benefit third quarter fourth quarter price timing differences negative tune million think important thing though actually take step back look fullyear results weve told year look going price timing impacts especially marktomarket open derivative positions going move around quarter quarter year looked energy products fullyear basis unsettled derivatives basically neutral price timing impacts would referred coming largely priced inventory program million negative look like said along quartertoquarter impact may little bit volatile look fullyear results tends settle jason gabelman got inventory yearend inventory impacts kathy mikells looked overall yearend inventory impacts would biggest impact upstream business part inventory adjustments made look gas inventories overall europe prices declining pretty significantly looked overall yearend adjustments inventory outside would called neutral modestly favorable largest favorability incurring energy products jason gabelman got thanks followup downstream maintenance seems like refining maintenance particularly high q wonder thats bunch things getting aggregated one quarter going higher year overall moving year theres something else going little color number outlook year would great thanks darren woods yeah ill take one would say turnaround timing spend area really function mix units bringing turnarounds around different refineries age units wouldnt take away structural change outlook year really function refineries units refineries coming turnaround work get units back maintenance schedule thats whats happening jason gabelman great thanks operator well go next ryan todd piper sandler ryan todd good thanks maybe higherlevel question following comments earlier competitive position relative past cycles competitive environment upstream oil looks far different many times past fewer players industry many largest peers strategically underinvesting oil think impacts global supply time look forward impact competitive position within space open door additional opportunities ep projects whether terms exploration leasehold competition project development even within asset transactions space seen impact date think evolves coming years changed competitive landscape darren woods yeah thanks ill take one ryan think hit good point point weve made historically underinvesting industry space depletion business keeping depletion offsetting covering growth find tight markets think broader public narrative moved space competitors stepped back investment tighten amount capacity thats coming supply gets brought time competitive alternatives loweremissions competitive alternatives address full set needs society theres going continue demand oil gas oil products think youre seeing potential continued tight markets think found certainly last five years continued commitment strengthening capabilities allow us bring competitively sourced oil gas environmentally responsible way resonated recognized resource owners around world think give us bit advantage respect opportunity set would say continue work earn advantage developing resources effectively bringing projects ahead schedule budget things frankly competitors challenged think supportive environment find focus space think appreciated gives us advantage versus rest competition ill also add time balancing risk transition investing lowemission side equation weve got unique

wondering profitability project gate relative youve thinking sanctioned darren woods yeah ill take said look beaumont concept project developed five plus years ago really looking would call feedstocks intermediate balances going refinery options optimize logistics piece equation justified project purely logistics optimizations lowercost transportation feed refinery thats thought robust wherever youre within cycle layer today commodity cycle fact high end refining margins expectation refining expansion much much better basis appropriated timing find cycle thats good news thats think important part investments make make sure participating phases cycle think even better news depending generate return investment even move commodity cycle point future find refining margins start come eventually well find bottom refining commodity cycle expansion position beaumont refinery well think continue incremental value refinery feel really positive making good progress mechanically

schedule anticipate bringing payara ahead schedule brought liza well brought online quickly began producing abovenameplate capacity fourth quarter feel really good quality projects operational ability bring run effectively making good progress weve got yellowtail government approval expect bigger fpso would say ahead schedule ahead expectations weve talked historically guyana resource base know continues grow continue make discoveries continue really optimize around discoveries thats really big part developing projects parallel developing projects continuing exploration continuing better quantify qualify resource base making sure projects optimized around theres balance striking around best optimize feel good frankly think government feels really good importantly development resource value associated manifesting country really important part equation always said coming winwinwin proposition needs win company needs win government guyana needs win people guyana thats seeing lot jobs lot economic opportunity opening guyana weve working guyanese government around project bring gas power country lower emissions reliable weve got work going help bring social services country think
