C. Douglas McMillon
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc.
Good morning, and thanks for joining us to hear about our fourth quarter results. Let's jump right in.

Our team delivered net sales growth of 7.6% and adjusted EPS growth of 9.3% excluding divestitures. We
continued to gain market share in food and consumables in the US, and comp transactions were positive.
Consumer demand during the quarter was strong, and the team overcame a number of challenges in the US and
around the world to deliver these strong results.

Going into the quarter, we were confident that we had the people, the products, and the prices to deliver. And we
did. Our inventory position improved. And we delivered high sell-throughs in seasonal categories across markets.
Food, consumables, and apparel were also strong globally. We comped low single digits in general merchandise
in the US against strong results last year. And Sam's Club saw broad-based strength across categories in the US
and in China.

Our merchants are doing a nice job of navigating the pressure from cost of goods inflation with our customers and
shareholders in mind. I like how we're mixing out the business. Consolidated gross profit rate increased 10 basis
points for the quarter, including more than 50 basis points in Walmart US. We're working closely with our

Walmart, Inc. (WMT)                                                                          Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                     17-Feb-2022

suppliers to manage inflation, finding a few places where we can roll back prices. And we're paying close attention
to how we manage our opening price point items. Q4 and the full year are proof points that we can keep our price
gaps in the range where we want them, grow market share, and deliver against our top and bottom line growth
algorithm.

Our associates did an amazing job of serving customers and members during this busy season, even as we faced
Omicron and supply chain challenges. This quarter's COVID leave peak was larger than anything we'd
experienced in 2020 or previously in 2021. We hired more associates than our plan called for to help fill that gap,
which negatively impacted expenses, but it was clearly needed.

I'm grateful to our associates and store and club management teams for how they set priorities on behalf of our
customers and members during the quarter. As I visit stores and clubs, it's inspiring to see how our team is
navigating such a fluid environment. They're delivering tremendous growth, while making significant progress
against our longer term strategy.

During the fiscal year just ended, excluding divestitures, we grew net sales by 9%, grew operating profit by 18%,
invested $13 billion in CapEx to grow our business, returned $16 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and
dividends, grew our advertising business globally to $2.1 billion, and took important steps to grow our US financial
services capabilities with agreements to make two key acquisitions.

Sometimes it feels like 2020 and 2021 were just one long year. If you look at growth since the beginning of fiscal
2021 through the end of fiscal 2022, excluding divestitures, our company is about 17% larger in terms of revenue,
31% larger in terms of operating income. And globally, our percentage of digital sales grew from 6% to 13%.

As the company grows, we're fueled by the new business model and flywheel we outlined last year. Our strategy
is coming to life. Ensuring that we deliver our strategy is where I invest the majority of my time. It starts with the
customer and earning primary destination. The big basket stock-up trip is important. It's foundational to our
relationship with families. We earn that shopping occasion by running great stores and clubs and offering
seamless pickup and delivery experiences, including for our Walmart+ and InHome members in the US.

Our membership offering, Walmart+, continues to be an important piece of what we're building. We're adding
capacity for pickup and delivery. We increased capacity by nearly 20% last year. And we expect to increase
capacity by another 35% this year.

For Walmart InHome, we recently announced an expansion of this membership service to make it available to
about 30 million homes in the US, up from 6 million. To enable the expansion, we're creating roles for more than
3,000 associate delivery drivers. The majority of these roles will be filled by existing experienced associates. We'll
be building out a fleet of all-electric delivery vans to support our delivery services and our goal of a zero emissions
logistics fleet by 2040.

Our flywheel is designed to serve families more broadly, deepening our relationship with them and creating a
healthy mix of merchandise and services for our business. Recently, we shared some news about our fintech
start-up in the US that will operate under the ONE brand going forward. The combined talent of our JV leadership
team and that of the pending acquisitions of ONE Finance and Even is impressive. And our plans are aggressive.
We can help our customers and Walmart+ members save money, have an experience with less friction, and help
strengthen the financial position for millions of families.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                  17-Feb-2022

As with our advertising business, our financial services capabilities cross borders. Our PhonePe business in India
is growing incredibly fast. And we have strong capabilities in Mexico, which is such an important market for us.

As we look to improve the customer experience and strengthen the mix of our business, expanding our
Marketplace is important. We added more than 20,000 new sellers to the platform in the US last year and expect
to add nearly 40,000 more this year. We're now up to nearly 170 million SKUs, and we're adding more every day.
We opened up our US Marketplace to sellers from India and created a dedicated team there to help sellers on-
board and grow. Many sellers are looking to diversify their business. And they're pushing us to add capabilities,
including the expansion of our Fulfillment Services.

We grew our US GMV delivered by our Fulfillment Services by 500% last year. We expect the robust growth will
continue this year as we add more capacity. For Q4, our Fulfillment Services represented 44% of total
Marketplace orders in India and 22% in Mexico.

Growing our Marketplace expands choice for our customers, helps our sellers grow, and enhances our profit
margins. Our plan for this year includes strengthening the experience for sellers and adding fulfillment capacity so
customers have access to more items faster. It's clear to me that we have years of profitable Marketplace and
Fulfillment Services growth ahead of us.

Staying on the theme of fulfillment and scaling new businesses, we recently launched Walmart GoLocal, a last-
mile delivery solution using our Spark Driver platform to help businesses of all sizes reach more customers.
GoLocal is making deliveries for The Home Depot and other large retailers, but I'm most excited about serving
small local retailers. We have nearly 1,000 GoLocal service pickup points, and we expect to end this year closer
to 5,000. This is good for customers, our clients, and for us as we lower the cost per order by increasing the
combined order size and the route density.

As we bring more customers, sellers, and suppliers into our ecosystem, it expands our ability to monetize those
relationships. A great example is our advertising business. Globally, it's been growing at a high rate, with high
margins and is now a $2.1 billion business in only a few years, and we expect this strong growth to continue. And
as our eCommerce business, including Marketplace, continues to grow, so will our advertising business. We're
taking the learnings from the US and India and growing in places like Mexico, Canada, and Chile.

Importantly, we're beginning to build tech platforms that can be leveraged in multiple countries. Our strong team
of technologists and our digital transformation enable global synergies. We see traction in our core business as
well as in our newer businesses. There is real power in the ability to make these pieces mutually reinforcing, to
design them such that one portion of a customer relationship leads them to another because it's easy and
intuitive. Connecting B2B opportunities, like advertising, enables us to grow earnings and make key investments
at the same time.

Because of how the flywheel is coming together, I feel great about our ability to deliver against the growth
algorithm we discussed last year of about 4% top line growth and operating income growth rates higher than
sales. We've highlighted the increased costs we had in Q4 from COVID, supply chain, and wages, and some of
these costs are likely to continue through part of this year. But I feel confident in the underlying strength of the
business and our ability to deliver the growth we expect. The Walmart we're building is becoming more impactful
for our customers and members, more digital, more automated, and more diversified on the top and bottom lines.

Now, let's move on to our performance by operating segment. I'll begin with Walmart US. The team had a great
holiday season and they drove comp sales of 5.6%. You know about our strength in food and consumables, but

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                                                                                                                                                  17-Feb-2022

despite the supply chain challenges, the seasonal hardlines execution for holiday looked good in stores. We're
continuing to navigate cost pressures and in-stock challenges, but, overall, I'm really proud of the team for
delivering the holiday season. And I believe we'll work our way to an improved in-stock level through the course of
the year.

Building a seamless omni-channel experience for customers and prioritizing convenience for them is critical. Our
stores have become hybrid. They're both stores and fulfillment centers. Last year, we increased the number of
orders coming from our stores by 170% versus the previous year, and that's on top of more than 500% from the
year before. Having inventory so close to so many customers is a competitive advantage. In some cases, we're
getting items to customers in hours, rather than days.

In Sam's Club US, the momentum continues. Sales and membership were strong. Excluding fuel and tobacco,
comps were 10.8% for the quarter and nearly 26% on a two-year stack. Membership income grew 9.1%, driven
by membership count, which reached another record high during the quarter. The team leveraged operating
expenses and grew operating income 24% excluding fuel. They had another fantastic quarter and year. Sam's
continues to drive digital innovation and add capabilities. Our Bold & Blue club remodels and our strengthened
pickup and delivery services will drive growth.

At Walmart International, we had another strong year, with good progress in all aspects of the flywheel. Overall,
sales were strong again in Q4, with growth of 9.8% in constant currency excluding divestitures. China, Mexico,
and Flipkart led the way. Our 21% eCommerce penetration is a new record and up nearly 400 basis points from
last year.

We get to serve a spectrum of holidays and festivals during the holiday quarter from Diwali and Big Billion Days in
India through to preparation for Chinese New Year. During Big Billion Days, 40% of sellers were first-time sellers
on the Marketplace, and more than 100,000 kiranas participated by making last-mile deliveries. This is strong
inclusive growth.

While our omni-channel model gives the gift of time, access and affordability remain important. We're expanding
our ecosystem. And we've made investments in areas such as healthcare, Marketplace, telecommunications, and
our online food business. A few great examples include the launch of Flipkart Health+ that aims to increase
access to affordable care in India and the acquisition of Foodmaestro in Canada to build more personalized
shopping experiences for customers. And BAIT, our value-based internet and telephone service that enables
customers in Mexico to enjoy digital connectivity, surpassed 2 million members.

It's great to see all three of our operating segments doing so well. I'm grateful to our strong and capable
leadership team and to all of our associates. We've had an incredible couple of years during these challenging
times. We have momentum in the business. We have aggressive plans, and we're executing on this strategy. It
still feels like we're just getting started.

I'll now turn it over to Brett.

Thanks, Doug. We wrapped up another great year with a strong fourth quarter and good momentum as we start
the new year. Over the last couple of years, each quarter has presented unique challenges, but I'm proud of how
we've navigated each one of those. The fourth quarter was no different, as we faced the rise of Omicron with its

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                    17-Feb-2022

impact on the supply chain and our associates. This resulted in some significant unexpected expenses, but,
despite that, we delivered the top and bottom line results we expected.

We continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to fulfill the vision we outlined last February. The US flywheel is
accelerating and is evident through initiatives like our pending fintech JV acquisitions, the launch of a new data
business, and acceleration of last-mile delivery. Sam's growth in membership income has been strong throughout
the year, as we expand omni options including Club Pickup. These and other key initiatives represent large
revenue and profit opportunities over the next few years.

For the full year, we had record sales of $568 billion with increased traffic to stores and clubs while eCommerce
penetration approached 13%. Walmart US grew sales by more than $23 billion and saw strong market share
gains in food and consumables. Over the past two years, our US segments have grown sales by $67 billion or
17% and operating income by 25%.

Now, let's discuss Q4 results. As a reminder, the previously announced international divestitures significantly
affect year-over-year comparisons, so my comments today will exclude the effect of divestitures. Total constant
currency revenue grew 7.9% to over $153 billion and reached another important milestone with quarterly net
sales exceeding $150 billion.

Consolidated gross margin rate increased 5 basis points, with Walmart US gross margin rate increasing by a
healthy 54 basis points, reflecting primarily price management resulting from cost increases in mix, along with
benefits from a growing advertising business, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. Supply chain costs
were over $400 million higher than expected, but we expect some of those costs to abate over time.

International gross margin rates were lower, due primarily to format mix. SG&A expenses deleveraged 19 basis
points, as increased US wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and lower COVID costs versus last year.
Although COVID costs were lower than last year, we had significantly higher associate leave costs in the US than
anticipated. In the first three quarters combined, COVID leave costs were about $600 million, but increased over
$450 million just in Q4, presenting an unexpected headwind of over $300 million. Despite these expense
challenges, adjusted operating income increased more than 6% and EPS increased more than 9%.

We're in a great financial position, enabling us to allocate capital towards both growth and shareholder returns.
Free cash flow was $11.1 billion for the year, down versus last year due primarily to inventory build throughout the
year, higher CapEx, and cost increases. We increased share repurchases significantly this year, with buybacks of
just under $10 billion, a pace we plan to continue or increase in the coming year given our view of the long term
value of the company.

In addition, we announced the 49th consecutive annual dividend increase this morning. ROI increased 90 basis
points to just under 15%, the best level in five years, due primarily to growth in operating income.

Now, let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart US had its first-ever $100 billion-plus sales
quarter with sales of $105 billion. Comp sales grew 5.6%, up more than 14% on a two-year stack. We continued
to grow grocery market share, as food comps increased high single digits while health and wellness, apparel,
seasonal, and automotive categories were also strong.

Transactions were up more than 3%, despite COVID pressures. eCommerce sales grew 1% against strong gains
last year, resulting in a 70% two-year stack. We continue to see elevated levels of cost inflation and have taken

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                17-Feb-2022

prudent steps to manage pricing, while having slightly wider price gaps than pre-pandemic. We have a good
balance of growing market share while managing price, with both customers and shareholders in mind.

We continue to make strong progress in some of our newer higher-margin initiatives. Walmart Connect
advertising experienced robust sales growth this year, with a strong pipeline of new advertisers and large growth
opportunities ahead. In fact, the number of active advertisers using Walmart Connect grew more than 130% year-
over-year. And about half of the ad sales came from automated channels in Q4, more than double last year. We
expect Walmart Connect to continue to scale over the next few years, with plans to become a top 10 ad business
in the mid-term.

Growing eCommerce Marketplace and WFS have been a priority over the past couple of years as we've invested
to expand fulfillment capacity, introduce new services for sellers, and double the number of items available for
customers. In fact, we expect to have over 200 million items in our eCommerce assortment by the end of the
year. The expansion of WFS has also been a key unlock in bringing more sellers to Walmart's Marketplace.

Customers increasingly want home delivery. And we had a six-fold increase in delivery in the fourth quarter
versus pre-pandemic levels. We continue expanding capabilities, including announcing the acceleration of
InHome delivery to 30 million households by year-end.

We also announced our new fintech business, ONE, in January with the pending acquisitions of fintech platforms
ONE Finance and Even.

SG&A expenses deleveraged 95 basis points, as increased wage costs were partially offset by strong sales and
lower total COVID-related expenses year-over-year. Still, as I mentioned earlier, COVID leave costs were much
higher than expected.

Operating income grew slightly, aided by strong margins as well as solid growth in membership and other income.
Inventory increased about 28% overall, including higher cost of goods due to inflation, mix, and higher than
normal in-transit shipments, reflecting continued efforts to improve in-stock.

International sales were strong, up nearly 10% led by China, Mexico, and Flipkart, as seasonal events, omni
growth, and good inventory position contributed to results. eCommerce sales in constant currency grew 21% on
top of strong gains last year, with growth of more than 75% on a two-year stack. China comps increased nearly
20% in constant currency, with continued strength from Sam's Clubs as well as more than 90% growth in
eCommerce sales. Comp sales in Mexico increased nearly 8% and grew faster than the market, according to
ANTAD.

Flipkart had another good sales quarter, aided by strong holiday events and favorable trends in monthly active
customers and users. We're also pleased with the strong growth of PhonePe, with TPV up more than 130%
versus last year, with a current run rate of $650 billion.

In Canada, comp sales were up 4.6%, led by in-store shopping, and comps increased more than 13% on a two-
year stack.

International adjusted operating income in constant currency increased nearly 3%, reflecting lower COVID costs,
partly offset by a gross margin rate decrease related to higher sales penetration from Sam's China and
eCommerce. For the full year, International adjusted operating income grew 12.7%, and we feel confident about
our International business as we had into the new year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                    17-Feb-2022


Sam's Club had another impressive quarter, with comps of 10.8% excluding fuel and tobacco, an increase of
nearly 26% on a two-year stack. Transactions increased 7%, and ticket was up 3.2%. eCommerce sales grew
21%, and we expanded the rollout of delivery capabilities of digital orders to nearly all clubs during the quarter.

Sam's is leveraging Walmart's GoLocal last-mile delivery service to provide more convenience to members.
Membership income was up more than 9%, with another record in member counts and strong Plus penetration.
Operating income was up 41%, as higher fuel and membership income as well as strong expense leverage were
partially offset by gross margin pressure from inflation and supply chain costs.

Now, let's turn to guidance. We feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and believe we can
deliver full year growth in FY 2023 that aligns with the growth algorithm we discussed last year. As you saw in Q4,
we're still challenged with increased costs related to COVID and supply chain disruptions. Our guidance assumes
that we will see some relief from that as the year progresses and that the US consumer remains in a generally
favorable economic position throughout the year. The comparisons against last year are unique, primarily due to
the timing of international divestitures and US stimulus in FY 2022.

As a reminder, the divestitures of our businesses in the UK and Japan were completed near the end of the first
quarter last year, contributing about $5 billion in sales and about $0.07 of EPS in Q1 FY 2022. Our guidance will
be ex-divestitures.

We expect total company sales to increase about 4%, with Walmart US comp sales slightly above 3% for the
year. Given the timing of stimulus overlaps, we expect about a 1% to 2% comp sales increase from Walmart US
in the first quarter, followed by somewhat higher comp sales growth throughout the remainder of the year.

We expect FY 2023 total company operating income to increase at a rate slightly higher than sales growth and
EPS to grow 5% to 6% versus FY 2022 adjusted EPS, due, in part, to our aggressive share repurchase program.
The quarterly profit growth cadence is expected to be quite variable, due to last year's US stimulus as well as
lapping wage investments initiated in February and September, 2021. As you would expect, the variability of the
quarters looks less extreme when viewed on a two-year stack.

We expect Q1 operating income and EPS to be down low double digits to low teens as we cycle the stimulus
effects from last year that resulted in nearly 30% operating income growth as well as increased wages this year.
On a two-year stack, Q1 operating income would still be up a mid-teens percentage. Q2 and Q3 operating income
and EPS are expected to increase at low to mid-single-digit rates, as year-over-year comparisons ease, due, in
part, to the moderation of stimulus benefits last year.

We expect higher growth rates in the back half of the year as we fully cycle wage investments, resulting in fourth
quarter operating income and EPS increasing by a high teens percentage. Q4 operating income will also benefit
from some timing versus FY 2022, particularly in International as well as cycling elevated COVID leave costs in
FY 2022.

Our effective tax rate is expected to increase to 25% to 26%, due primarily to earnings mix.

For the year, we expect gross margin rates to increase due to pricing, mix, and new business initiatives, although
there will be variability quarter-to-quarter, as is usually the case. For the first time in a while, we expect some
expense deleveraging as we continue to see elevated supply chain, wage and tech costs. We'll continue the

multiyear journey of accelerated capital investment focused on increasing fulfillment capacity, automation, and
technology to enhance productivity.

FY 2022 CapEx was about $13.1 billion lower than anticipated, due to timing of projects impacted by supply chain
challenges. Due to that and continued investment in strategic priorities, we anticipate this year's CapEx being at
the upper end of the guidance we gave last year of 2.5% to 3% of sales.

In closing, I'm really pleased with our FY 2022 results and very confident as I look to this year and to the future.
The company is in an enviable position to serve customers and members and also to achieve our financial goals,
benefiting shareholders.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to double-click on one of the comments you made in your remarks
regarding elevated levels of inflation. And I think you signaled that you are seeing slightly wider price gaps versus
pre-pandemic. Can you maybe give us some sense of how much inflation you're observing real-time, how much
those price gaps have widened? And then what your expectations are for the quarters as the year progresses?
Thank you.

Hey, Steph. Good morning. This is John with Walmart US. First, I just want to appreciate our teams for all they
delivered in the last quarter. The $105 billion sales number has been impressive, given all the challenges they
have. And I just want to thank the teams for everything they've been through the last couple years.

When it comes to pricing, we really take a long term view on this. And we manage pricing for both customers and
shareholders. We're constantly monitoring our price gaps to competitors, and we'll continue to do that as we move
forward. And then, what we're seeing right now is not only gaps that we're proud of that are valuable for our
customers, but we're also seeing the opportunity to increase some of our rollbacks in stores. And we're really
proud of the team. We're seeing about the same number of rollbacks now that we had at the end of Q1 last year.

So while we have supply chain challenges and other costs coming through, the teams are doing a nice job
managing mix and pricing and looking after both our customers and our shareholders.

Hi. Good morning. Just a couple quick questions. The first one, really thanks for giving us the advertising piece.
Can you just elaborate a little bit more just on the growth that you've experienced to get to the $2 billion number
and just how quickly you do expect that to ramp? And given the fact that you gave us the $2 billion number, Doug,
would you be willing to give us how many people have signed up for the Walmart+ membership?

Bob, you got one, and you want both. That doesn't surprise me. I'll start with the advertising number, and John
can add here. The business model is changing. I think that's the headline. We've got a business that's becoming
increasingly digital. The eCommerce business, first-party, third-party is growing. It gives us the opportunity to
grow advertising income. It's grown at a fast rate, and it's growing across markets.

The US is important in that number, but India, Mexico, and other markets are going to have growth there, too. And
the margins are helpful. They help us keep prices low for customers, and they help us deliver the operating
income number percentage. So we're excited about what the future looks like as it relates to the growth of the
advertising business.

We're not going to share Walmart+ yet. I don't really want to have the company defined by one metric. And with
subscriptions being such a topic these days, everybody gets really focused on that. Walmart is always going to be
a business where you need to look across and see how the omni-channel business is playing out. There are
going to be times when eCommerce grows faster than stores. And as we've seen recently, stores are attractive
during certain periods of time.

Walmart+ is important. It helps us grow our eCommerce business. It helps us deepen the relationship with
customers and have more data. And, at some point, we'll probably talk about that number. And, by the way, there
are other types of memberships, not just in Sam's Club across the world, but in some of our other businesses,
too, they are growing.

So I think there will probably be a number of membership type metrics over time that you'll want to keep an eye
on, but I don't think it would be good if everybody got overly focused on Walmart+. Our ability to serve people with
pickup and delivery has improved as we've made these investments. It's one of the reasons why we continue to
tell you how much capacity we're growing to do that.

Yeah, Bob, this is John. And I'd add a couple things. First, I think the advertising business is a reflection of the
momentum we have in total Walmart US. And I'm really proud of the way the team has helped position us to serve
customers any way they want to be served, whether that's at home in their refrigerator, at their front door, at the
curb, or in store.

And the Walmart Connect business specifically, the reason we named it Connect is we are connecting buyers,
sellers, suppliers, and customers. And we have a unique opportunity to be able to help sellers and suppliers reach
customers in a way that's effective for them, grow their business, and do it in a way that is positioned on top of an
omni-retail platform.

So certainly excited about the growth. I'm excited about the capacity additions in-store and in Walmart Fulfillment
Services. Those enable sellers to be able to transact more frequently with our customers. And that's really the key
to the growth of advertising is have the large seller and supplier base that can reach our customer base.

Hi. Thanks very much. So, Doug, I wanted to ask you a question. You've made the plane analogy in the past with
respect to knowing when and where you want to land the plane, but there are moving parts to getting to the
destination. So I wanted to just ask bigger picture, when you think about 2023 specifically, well, calendar 2022,
where you think the biggest source of upside could be to landing the plane and then also where you would put the
biggest sources of risks on landing.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                               A
Thanks, Karen. I think the biggest sources of risk are external amidst been an unusual last year or two. And
figuring out how you lap stimulus, what happens with inflation, both on the cost of goods side as well as on the
operating side, will cause us to have to be good managers. But I think we've demonstrated over time that we have
a lot of really good managers at Walmart.

In terms of upside, I'm excited about what's happening in our stores and clubs. We've got great momentum in
Sam's. There's a lot to be excited about in International. India continues to be really exciting. Walmex is kind of
going from strength to strength. The Sam's business in China is good. So I think that Sam's International can
contribute.

And on the Walmart US side, John, you can jump in here, too, I think we've got an opportunity to continue to
improve both stores and eCommerce. And the fact that we're now up to 170 million items for customers is
exciting. And the way sellers are responding to fulfillment and seller services and that relationship is really
encouraging.

So I think Marketplace is one of those areas where we can see growth, including that last-mile component that
we're building out. I think that's exciting, too.

I do, too. And, Karen, I mentioned just a second ago, proud of the momentum and the positioning being an omni-
retailer, but also excited about the shape of the business model and how it's changing. Brett laid out last year,
early, the growth algorithm and the way that the business model could change over time.

And those services that Doug just referenced for sellers, including fulfillment and Marketplace, last-mile, GoLocal,
all these things help so many businesses reach customers in addition to just the Walmart business. And they all
have an impact on the operating model, which I'm really quite excited about. And these are components that will
help customers, number one. They'll help shareholders. And they'll help us position the way that we offer value to
customers all across the country.

And GoLocal, we talked about the number of points that we have today. That's expanding. Our last-mile business
is expanding. We'll have a fleet of electric vehicles coming online over the next couple years. So there's just a lot
going on that is going to take a lot of friction out of customers' lives, help them stay in stock at home. And then,

with the improvement in fundamentals over the next year, I'm also very excited about our ability to manage
through whatever external forces that we see.

We've got a lot of experience doing this. We've got great teams that are ready for this, and the strategy is really
clear.

Hey. Good morning, everyone. My question is on guidance. In 2022, you beat your comp guidance and your EBIT
guidance both by healthy amounts. If 2023 ends up being better than what you just guided, is it driven by sales, or
is there a chance the margin can perform better within the 3%, given some of the alternative?

And then, just to clarify, Brett mentioned the Q4 EBIT growth for fiscal 2023. Is there any way you could unpack it
a little? Because it's a big change and jump, but it seems like you're going to be lapping some hefty SG&A
growth. And you said something about international laps, so just try to maybe – it's not as steep as it sounds, I
think, if we look at some of the pieces.

Hey, Simeon. It's Brett. I'll kick off. I think a lot of what Doug and John just said is if we get to the end of this year
and we've done better than we've laid out for guidance, I think it's a lot of what they just talked about. It's our new
businesses that are higher margin continue to grow. Sales momentum continues. We assume, obviously, that it's
going to continue with a 4% sales growth. It's a big number on top of what we've already done. So it could be
sales-driven and it can continue to be margin-driven as well, as these new businesses develop, as our general
merchandise business gets stronger, which helps with mix. It's all of those things.

And we always talk about there are so many levers that we can pull at different times when we need to. It's also
all those levers that can actually play to our advantage in any given year and any given time. So I just feel good
about the momentum of the business. I said this to [ph] Gordon (37:00), this morning. I'm as optimistic as I've ever
been about the business and the shape of the business model.

To answer Q4 specifically, there's a couple things. There's some holiday timing in International. We also had
some impacts of some impairments this quarter. Some of that was adjusted out. But it's those things, but also the
costs. When you look at the supply chain costs and the COVID costs in Q4, that's a big change. And we do
expect some abatement of costs over the year. When that happens, how that happens, obviously, is to be seen.
But it's those things that help that Q4 operating income.

year, given the stimulus lap, the inflation, and other uncertainties. So how did you factor all of that in as you were
planning the year ahead? You probably could have gotten away with citing something less than your algorithm
excluding divestitures, so is there a risk that you have a recency bias where the business in January was good?
And, hopefully, this doesn't come across as snarky, but do you think you have more visibility into the macro than
the investment community or others? There's just a lot of uncertainty out there right now.

Michael, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to the 4% and greater than 4%, what we told you a year ago is that
that is something we believe we can deliver or beat over time. And, as Brett told you, when we made that
commitment and shared those numbers, there are going to be time periods that are higher and time periods that
are lower. But over time, we think that's a really sound set of numbers to share. And we thought it was important
to repeat that because we still have that confidence. And we have that confidence because of all the pieces that
we have been talking about. The strategy is coming to life. The business model is changing.

As it relates to this year in particular, we've got opportunities to improve in-stock. We've got opportunities to
improve store and club standards because of what happened with COVID leave. There's just upside. And there
will definitely be challenges. We know that, for sure. But we just have these different opportunities to make
choices to deliver the results. And we believe that it was important to repeat the number.

Hey, Michael. Something that Doug said that's really important about improvement. One of the most fun parts of
working at Walmart is having such a large team just every day get up and try to be better than they've been and
run a better business, and I've enjoyed that for almost 30 years. But one of the things that's really important in
your question is we serve really all income groups across all geographies in the US.

And last year, we saw growth amongst income groups and geographies. So I think that's a clear reflection of the
number of choices that we offer customers. We offer customers an experience through Walmart.com and
eCommerce. We offer customers pickup experiences. We offer in-store and just about everything in-between,
including InHome delivery which will expand to a significant number of households, up to 30 million households,
this year.

So I think our ability to serve all across is quite important going forward. And for the team this year, we'll be really
focused on execution. And I know Sam's would say exactly the same thing. But across the geographies and
income, we're well represented. And we're going to try really hard to deliver great execution for customers all
across the year.

And, Michael, you started by saying that the Walmart US customer looks like the US population. And it does, to a
really large degree. And so we'll serve everybody. And during periods of inflation like this, middle income families,
lower middle income families, even wealthier families become more price-sensitive. And that's to our advantage.

So we have been through this before. And we run with inflation around the world all the time. Inflation is a different

South America and Mexico and other places and just kind of understand what that looks like.

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You had mentioned improving in-stocks throughout the year.
We were just wondering how you would categorize how Q4 ended up from an in-stock level and what areas could
still benefit from improved inventory. And can you talk about any sequential improvements you may see in the
supply chain and how you view the cadence of the supply chain challenges throughout the rest of 2022?

Good morning, Kate. This is John. Let me talk about Q4, and then I'll come back to the supply chain. I think, in
general, we were seeing really nice improvements in in-stock late in Q3, early Q4. We were happy with how the
holiday season turned out, including the ability to deliver seasonal and hardlines across the quarter, which you
saw.

A couple strengths that really stood out were the apparel business and our health and wellness business were
both strong throughout the quarter. Those resulted – due to demand, those resulted in pretty decent sell-throughs.
And then in January, with the effects of Omicron, we took a step back in in-store, in-stock and online, but what
we're seeing right now is better flow-through all across the supply chain. You heard the increase in inventory, a
large reflection of what is inbound. So we see recovery happening pretty quick. There are a couple categories in
the store that you'll see some out-of-stocks in that are really national issues.

As far as the supply chain, we talked about it in Q3, there were some significant improvements in flow-through at
ports, changing lead times, getting containers moved into the country, and that's all helped. But just a reminder.
About two-thirds of what we sell is made, manufactured or assembled here in the United States, and we see
growth across those categories as well.

So I think we'll see much better flow the next few weeks and months and get us into really good position as we
lean into the first and second quarters.

Hey, good morning. Congrats on a great year. And hats off, Brett, on a wonderful career at Walmart. My question
is on the consumer again. And I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any noticeable changes in spending patterns
by income cohorts in light of inflation, lap of stimulus. You talked about January being the best on a two-year
basis, but just wondering if you could unpack it a little bit by income level.

But definitely has made a nice impact. Chuck, a couple things. We said a second ago, we need to serve the
country broadly. We see the ability to serve all income groups. And things like private brand versus branded, we
don't see any change at this point. We see strong demand. Private brand penetration is about flat.

So at this point, we see really strong demand and a customer who is in good shape with a strong balance sheet.
So we're optimistic that the inventory pull-throughs that we have done and have in transit will get us in a great
position to be able to serve customers as we get into this fiscal year.

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions, and I'll add my congratulations to you, Brett. Just two
questions. One I guess similar question maybe that's been tried to ask, but there is some concerns going into the
quarter about whether or not you could maintain this kind of earnings growth algorithm against the strong results
in 2021. And so maybe just can you help us understand the underlying factors that enable you to grow on this
higher base? You talked a little bit about Connect and the advertising business. Is there just underlying progress
in eCommerce profitability? We don't talk about it the same way anymore, but just what do you think are those
underlying drivers that help you maintain this level of growth?

Kelly, we're all wanting to answer that, so I'll try to be brief. The business model, the income statement is just
changing shape, and I think that kind of the headlines are the company is becoming more digital. It is starting to
become more automated and over time will become even more automated. And when you look at the gross
margin number, we can manage it.

Some of you like to watch gross margin, as I guess makes sense, quarter-to-quarter. As Brett was reminding us
yesterday, you can drive yourself crazy doing that. Gross margin over time, I mean, look at our track record. We
can manage gross margin.

Now, then below gross margin, we've got productivity opportunities. And technology, whether it's an app in a store
for an associate on the sales floor or robotics in a distribution center, creates an opportunity for more productivity
over time. That is helpful. And then, you get to these other businesses, like the advertising business, the last-mile
delivery business, Fulfillment Services for eCommerce, the Marketplace itself, and these are helpful businesses
from a margin point of view. And as they become a larger percent to total, the shape of the income statement
changes. And our confidence in that, not only in the US, but around the world in the markets we operate in, is
high. And so that's why you sense that confidence from us.

Brett, do you want to go next?

I'd just add a couple things there. First, having digital relationships with customers is so important. More and
more, we fulfill from stores. The stores are stores, but they also act as fulfillment centers, as we said earlier. So
this ability to interact with customers digitally is important. Our workforce is becoming more digital. We've got over
1 million associates who have a device in their hands from the minute they walk in until they leave. So that's
saving them time.

And then, finally, I'd just reiterate what Doug mentioned, is automation in supply chain and using automation to
augment the things that our associates don't want to spend as much time doing so they can spend the time on the
things that are value-added, like in-stock and availability.

And I would just close by saying our optimism in improvements this year is we've got a lot of room to improve in
in-stock and customer ability that we've seen over the last couple years. We're really proud of the growth. We
know we could have done a lot more, had we had the inventory position at the right time and the right place. So
I'm really optimistic that there is upside to top line.

You mentioned eCommerce. We're continuing to manage contribution profit with eCommerce business as a
stand-alone vertical. And apparel and home are important, and we've seen growth there over the last couple of
years. And then the Marketplace helps. And the Marketplace has been scaling faster, as you can see in the 170
million number.

Oliver, you covered a lot there, and your voice was breaking up a bit. But we think we got it.

On the future of shopping, it's really exciting. There are so many things that we can imagine. One of our
challenges is just setting priorities and not trying to do too much. But we've got obviously a great strength in
stores, and I think that that's clear. The pickup business has been terrific in the US for many years now. Delivery
is growing around the world.

This delivery that's happening that's unattended is exciting. And this Walmart InHome business, which leads
towards just keeping people in stock, and they don't have to really think about buying the items they buy all the
time. And we then use that data to serve our impulse items will be part of that future. We do think that social
commerce around the world and what happens with wearables and AR and mixed reality will be part of our future,
and we're obviously thinking about that and working on that.

And this key, as I mentioned in my remarks, of stitching it together, whether it's fintech or healthcare, and, John,
you should jump in on future of shopping, fintech and healthcare, too. The way you stitch that together, so that
one business becomes the default for the other is the magic of it. If we can really become great from a financial
services point of view, we can take out friction and cost for customers, make it more delightful to transact with us.

They'll even not even really think about transacting, John, as we change the shopping experience as it relates to
checkouts in the future as well as on our app and in other digital forms.

Yeah. Oliver, on the consumer, I'll just start there, I see the same way Doug is, very exciting to see some of the
changes. Because the consumer, which, historically, in the past, we might have thought of as a consumer fits in a
segment, consumers really are in a segment depending on the day of the week or the hour of the day.
Consumers sometimes need things right away, which we can do in under two hours with Express Delivery. They
may need a pickup order in a couple days, or they may need something for a kid's birthday party this weekend.
And we can work with all of those, and that's really exciting.

On fintech and healthcare, specifically, those are on our flywheel for important reasons. One, in fintech, we're
excited about the potential acquisitions that we mentioned, pending regulatory approval. But we're looking for
modern innovative ways to offer customers the ability to access affordable financial solutions and financial
products. A considerable number of customers, including middle income customers, are underserved when it
comes to financial services. And we believe that we have a role that can help there and we can do it in a way
that's digital.

And then, just going on to health and wellness, it's a big question with all these things that you have in there. But
the health business was our fastest growing comp business in Q4. We're excited about continuing to be able to
serve customers at the pharmacy. Our pharmacists and pharmacy techs have done a tremendous job this last
year in serving customers. And we're seeing with the addition of things like our telehealth company and other
services, the ability for our pharmacists and tech to practice at the top of their licenses and really help customers
live better.

Hey, thanks. Good morning. There's been a lot of great questions, so I want to ask a more specific one. You
mentioned some places to roll back prices. I'm curious. Is that because you see less inflation in those categories?
I suspect not. Or is it because you see the opportunity for that to really resonate with the consumer? And within
that idea, are there categories, places where you're seeing a change in consumer behavior, whether it's trading
down or otherwise, that you think creates a unique opportunity for you all?

Hey, Ben. It's John. Thanks for the question. On the rollbacks, this is all about making sure the customers see
value at a time when prices are rising in so many parts of the economy, being able to offer a customer value and
fight inflation is what we do. It's what our merchants do. And that will continue. As I said earlier, the count of
rollbacks today is up pretty significantly from the end of the third quarter and about to where it was at the end of
the first quarter last year.

So I'd say – I was in the store across the street earlier this morning. And we've got rollbacks in consumer
electronics and parts of dry grocery. And those values really matter as customers become more concerned and
they think more about inflationary pressures. So we'll continue to be an everyday low price retailer. That is our
platform. We want to offer great values with price gaps that deliver for shareholders as well each and every day
that we operate. But we'll make sure that customers see value in key categories as we get into this year.

Good morning, everyone. I guess a bit of a follow-up on that question. As you guys hold down prices, despite
higher procurement cost to drive price gaps, are you seeing any kind of competitive response? Or do you find
you're almost competing against yourself because other companies just can't hold down prices the way you can?

have to spend more of our time paying attention to that. We do mix across categories. We think about things like
opening price points and protecting for a lower income family some of the things that they need from a staples
point of view.

And then, as John mentioned, we use rollbacks to communicate not only the reality of prices are coming down in
some places, but the emotion or perception we want customers to have about us being there for them and
earning their trust during a period of time like this.

So I wouldn't say that we're unique in having to work through that. Of course, everybody is. But we are likely a bit
unique with the depth of experience that we have and the talent of our team to be able to manage it and our long-
standing supplier relationships and the way we work with them to try and help them get through this situation as
well. The amount of communication between us and suppliers is always high. It's particularly high right now.

Yeah, it is. And I'd just refer to things that we said in the past. A merchant here has so many levers between mix
and categories, what they feature on the home page. This morning at the top of the home page is a section on
rollbacks. They can change that. They can change monitors. They can change features. There are just so many
things they can do to manage mix over time that it puts our team into a good position to do this.

We've got experienced people who know how to do this. And we have a number of associates here in the US that
worked in other markets where inflation is quite common. And that's really been helpful this last year to have that
expertise inside the business.

Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to take a shot at some of the comp questions that have been asked
prior. You talked about 1% and 2% in the US in the first quarter, sort of 3s in 2Q and 3Q. That would suggest you
accelerate roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. So I guess my question is you'll be going against sort of peak food at
home inflation, some elevated SNAP benefits. So I want to get into sort of how you're thinking about getting there.
Do you expect any deflation to occur? Do you expect share gains in grocery to accelerate as some of your
customer base sort of seeks out more value? And then embedded in that, is there accelerated growth in general
merchandise as you fill out the assortment and the fulfillment options?

Hey, Christopher, I'll say a couple things regarding the question. A lot of the phasing that are in the forecasts
definitely include strong customer demand. They include better inventory positions. We talked about inventory in
total being up 28%, with a considerable amount of that that is in transit on the way, which does include general
merchandise, but also as a reflection of what we believe will be better in-stock positions in food and consumables.

The quarterly phasing also has the lapping of stimulus last year. And the month we're in, we had a large ice storm
last year in Texas. And then in the months of March and April, we had stimulus that was significant. So it does
reflect that across the quarters. And I don't think I'd add anything else to that, Brett, unless you have anything.

No, I'd say, Chris, as you can imagine, the quarterly phasing is more challenging than normal, just given the
comparisons that we're up against. But I think, as John said, there's a number of different things during the year
that make us feel confident in the total year. And we've given you as good as we feel like we can today on where
we think it will stack up for the quarters. But there's going to be some quarterly variability, certainly, during the
year.

C. Douglas McMillon
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc.
Thanks again for your time and attention.

I'd just summarize by saying it's great to have momentum in all three segments as we start this year. I think it's
clear that we're changing to serve customers and members in the way that they want to be served. And having
stores and an eCommerce business, pickup, delivery, fulfillment centers, a marketplace, all of those things are
helpful as it relates to that. And the great thing about it is the way that we're building these and designing them is
that the company can grow earnings and grow the bottom line while we're doing it.

The business model changes. And it enables the customer and member to benefit and our business to benefit at
the same time. So I'm excited about the short term momentum and looking forward to the year. Thank you, all.

for your participation.
