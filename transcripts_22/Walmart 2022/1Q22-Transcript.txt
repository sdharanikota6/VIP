MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Greetings. Welcome to Walmart's fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings call. At this time, all participants
are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator
instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dan Binder with Investor Relations.

Daniel Binder
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate FP&A, Walmart, Inc.
Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. I'm joined by a
few members of our executive team, including: Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; Brett Biggs,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Furner, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. In a
few moments, Doug and Brett will provide you with an update on the business and discuss first quarter results.
That will followed by our question-and-answer session.

Before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-
looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors
identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a
cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire Safe Harbor statement and non-
GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.Walmart.com.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon.

C. Douglas McMillon
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc.
Good morning and thanks for joining today's call. Our results for the first quarter were strong. We're pleased with
our sales momentum and adjusted EPS growth of 43% versus last year. We had strong performance in all three
segments.

As the pandemic continues, it's impacting the countries where we operate in different ways. So our teams are
adapting to overcome the challenges and deliver the strong results we're sharing today. We continue to be
grateful to all of our associates for their dedication to serving others.

2021 brings its own unique challenges and uncertainty, but, overall, my optimism is higher than it was at the
beginning of the year for several reasons. In the U.S., economic stimulus is clearly having an impact, but we also
see encouraging signs that our customers want to get out and shop. Our execution is improving, despite the
hurdles presented by the pandemic.

The second half will likely have more uncertainty than a normal year, but we like our position. Our stores are
getting stronger. And our eCommerce capabilities are expanding as we continue to grow. Customers will decide
how and when they want to shop. And they'll find us ready, whether they want to shop in store, pick up an order or
have it delivered.

Walmart, Inc. (WMT)                                                                          Corrected Transcript
Q1 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                    18-May-2021

Key elements of our strategy are coming together nicely. We saw an acceleration of traffic in our stores, gained
market share in grocery, improved in-stock levels and grew eCommerce sales globally by 43% in constant
currency, excluding recent divestitures. Global eCommerce penetration now represents over 12% of total
company sales, an increase of 340 basis points over last year.

Looking ahead, we'll navigate the supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures, whether that's in cost of
goods or wages. We'll monitor our price gaps and adjust as appropriate, with both customers and shareholders in
mind.

As it relates to COVID-19, the past several weeks have been more challenging in some countries. India, Canada,
Chile and South Africa are priorities at the moment. Supporting our associates is our primary focus, but we're also
investing our resources to support the countries as we find opportunities to do so. In India, we're donating oxygen
concentrators, PPE and financial support.

When it comes to helping people get vaccinated, we're engaged in multiple countries. In the U.S., we've
administered millions of doses. We're taking steps to encourage our associates and everyone to become
vaccinated. Given CDC guidance, our U.S. associates that have been vaccinated can now work without a mask if
they choose to, and we've added a cash incentive as one more step to encourage vaccinations. All of our
Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies in the U.S. are administering vaccines, and we can provide them without an
appointment.

We've also collaborated with national and local organizations to support more than 200 community events across
the country, so far. In India, we're facilitating vaccinations for our associates and their households and our Flipkart
and PhonePe contractors, more than 200,000 people. Across the countries where we operate, we'll keep looking
for more places to make a difference. This pandemic won't be over until it's over for everyone.

In addition to combating the pandemic, we also announced a new commitment to U.S. manufacturing during the
quarter. Over the next 10 years, we've set a goal to purchase an additional $350 billion on items made, grown, or
assembled in the U.S. We estimate this commitment will create more than 750,000 new American jobs and avoid
100 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.

We also want to make it easier for manufacturing in the U.S. to flourish. That's why we're launching an initiative
called American Lighthouses. We'll bring together partners from the supplier community, academia and
government, among other groups, to identify and overcome top-down barriers to U.S. production.

We also have other exciting news to share as we continue to invest in the technologies of tomorrow. In
collaboration with ENGIE North America, a power generator and services company, we're adding more than 500
megawatts to the U.S. renewable grid through three separate wind projects. Together, these projects are
expected to supply renewable energy to hundreds of stores, clubs and distribution facilities annually. That's
enough renewable energy to power over 240,000 average American homes for a year. That's on top of the 4
gigawatts of renewable energy currently supplied by our projects globally. This is one more example of the
important work we're doing to become a regenerative company.

Now let's talk more about our results for the quarter. Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter. The team
delivered for our customers as they shopped in our stores and online and additional government stimulus
payments created a tailwind. Our comp sales of 6%, including 37% growth in eCommerce, were strong. Strength
was broad-based across categories, including apparel, home, hardlines and seasonal.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                    18-May-2021

I recently visited stores, clubs and supply chain facilities in New Jersey, Delaware, DC, Ohio, New Mexico, Texas,
Illinois, California and Florida. I continue to be grateful for the job our associates are doing, and I'm impressed by
their spirit. They're operating safely in a pandemic, improving our in-stock and standards, working hard to fulfill
pickup and delivery orders and vaccinating millions. Doing all those things at once isn't easy, and we've had our
challenges. But our associates continue to step up, and they're strengthening our position as they do it.

In the U.S., our first party retail business is strong, but we're also making good progress in other important parts of
our business. Marketplace GMV, fulfillment services and advertising income with Walmart Connect are all strong.

The flywheel we showed you in February is being built. Each component is positioning us to serve the customer
better, while diversifying the model. As we previously shared, the top of the flywheel starts with being the best,
first place people shop. Store remodels, investments in pickup and delivery capacity and sales of Walmart+ fall
into this category of activities. We need more capacity to get ahead of demand, and we remain convinced these
investments are smart ones. This is one of the keys to selling more Walmart+ memberships, which is an important
piece of our strategy over time.

In addition to work at the top of the flywheel, we'll continuously add brands, assortment and capabilities to our
eCommerce general merchandise business, with first party inventory and Marketplace expansion. We'll invest in
our general merchandise business and grow in higher margin categories. The announced acquisition of Zeekit is
a great example. This start-up combines fashion and technology through a dynamic virtual fitting room and
underscores the desire to grow our apparel business aggressively.

We continue our work to build a larger Health & Wellness business and help customers and associates have a
better experience when it comes to their healthcare. Our acquisition of MeMD is a big step in that direction.
Adding a telehealth capability was important. Just as we're doing with core retail, we're building an omnichannel
Health & Wellness business.

At Sam's Club, the momentum continues. Our items are improving. Membership and sales comps are strong. And
the team keeps adding and scaling capabilities, like curbside. We're seeing strength in categories associated with
social gatherings, as well as an increase in Business Member activity. Categories like restaurant supplies are
coming back. We saw tremendous growth in membership income for the quarter, and overall membership counts
are at an all-time high. Like our stores' business, government stimulus helped our results, but I'm confident the
underlying business is strong and moving in the right direction for our members.

Our International team has been busy transitioning the portfolio to higher growth markets, and it's working. As
you'll recall, we recently divested our businesses in the UK, Japan and Argentina. And as a result, net sales for
the quarter declined about 11% year-on-year. On a like-for-like basis, when we remove the recently divested
markets, net sales increased 5.1%. These are good results and demonstrate the segment's ability to deliver
growth for the enterprise.

In India, for the first quarter, Flipkart and PhonePe continued to experience strong growth, as annualized total
payment value run rate at PhonePe grew by more than 150% versus last year. At Flipkart, monthly active
customers and users are key metrics, and we're performing well. Our recent announcement of our intent to
acquire Cleartrip, a leading online travel company, underscores our commitment to transform the customer
experience through digital commerce.

Our growing base of customers means we need to continue to add new capabilities, including areas such as
logistics and data storage. The recently announced partnership with Adani Group will help us do just that.

Walmex continues to be strong and the flywheel is coming to life. Our assets in this market uniquely position us to
serve customers in new ways, and they're responding. In Mexico, sales in eCommerce increased 166%, and our
same-day delivery service is now available from 680 locations. Similar to the U.S., we're expanding our business
to include more than just traditional retail. A few areas of note include: the advertising business, which saw an
increase of more than 100% in new advertisers; and our new mobile phone services network that provides voice,
data and home broadband, bringing access and value to our customers. We doubled the number of users of
these services during the quarter, as customers enjoy the convenience of adding data to their plan right at the
checkout.

In China, our eCommerce business and Sam's Club continue to resonate with customers and members. Helped
by a strong Chinese New Year, the club business delivered strong sales across all categories, leading to double-
digit comp sales growth. We grew overall eCommerce sales 60% on top of impressive growth last year.

Results from our business in Canada were good, even as lockdown measures intensified as the quarter
progressed. We started with strong sales in stores and eCommerce, but COVID-19-related restrictions on sales of
certain merchandise categories towards the end of the quarter pressured our performance. The underlying
business is strong, and we're confident in our omnichannel model for this market.

I'll close today by thanking everyone for a strong quarter. It all starts with our associates and their focus on
serving our customers and members. We're being aggressive and dialing up innovation and speed. We're moving
fast to learn new skills and to sharpen our edge on existing ones, and we'll move even faster as we invest in key
areas to accelerate growth into the future. Thank you for your interest in our company.

Now, I'll turn it over to Brett.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc.
Thanks, Doug. We're pleased with strong first quarter results and the continued momentum in the business, with
both strong sales and profit growth. While stimulus spending benefited results, it's exciting to see the continued
progress in our underlying business as we execute on the fundamentals and progress with our omni strategy.
Newer businesses within our ecosystem, like advertising and fulfillment services, are growing rapidly, helping
margins and allowing us to continue to invest in other strategic priorities. Our unique assets, value proposition and
financial strength put us in a great competitive position to win, keeping the customer at the center of all we do.

As we expected we're growing grocery market share again in the U.S. compared to last year, according to
Nielsen. Value and assortment will continue to resonate with customers, as does the convenience we provide with
our omni shopping options.

Now, let's discuss Q1 results. As we've mentioned previously, the divestitures in the UK, Japan and Argentina
significantly affect year-over-year comparisons. We outlined the anticipated effect of divestitures on key financial
metrics when we provided guidance in February. So my comments today will focus on the underlying business,
excluding the effect of divestitures.

Total constant currency revenue growth was strong [ph] at 5.8% to more than $132 billion (13:15), with underlying
business trends continuing to improve, while stimulus spending benefited U.S. sales even versus last year's
consumer stock-up phase and initial stimulus.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                 18-May-2021

Walmart U.S. comp sales were stronger than expected, up 6% in the quarter and up 16% on a two-year stack.
Sam's Club grew comp sales nearly 11%, excluding fuel and tobacco, and International sales growth was strong,
increasing more than 5% in constant currency with strength in India, Canada and China.

Globally, eCommerce sales growth remains robust at more than 40%. Gross profit margin increased 96 basis
points, led by Walmart U.S., reflecting mix shifts, due, in part, to stimulus spending, lower markdowns and lapping
last year's COVID-related stock-up which was more focused on food and consumables. As expected, SG&A
expenses were pressured by increased wage and technology investments in the U.S., partially offset by lower
COVID-related costs, resulting in 21 basis points of deleverage. Overall, though, I feel good about expense focus
across the company.

Operating income on a constant currency basis was up over 28%, and adjusted EPS of $1.69 was 43% higher
than last year's Q1 adjusted EPS. The divested businesses contributed $0.07 of EPS, due to partial period
ownership in the quarter. GAAP EPS was $0.97, which includes net losses on our equity investments as well as
the incremental loss in international divestitures. Operating cash flow declined about $4 billion, due primarily to
inventory increases versus last year when in-stock levels were much lower due to stock-up shopping. We stepped
up buybacks during the quarter with $2.8 billion of share repurchase. We continue to feel great about the value of
the company.

Now, let's discuss the quarterly results for each segment. Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter, aided by
stimulus spending and underlying improvements in the grocery business, as well as strength in re-opening
categories, such as travel, celebration and personal care. We're particularly encouraged by the improving trends
in store transactions, which turned solidly positive in April for the first time in a year.

We also saw strong market share gains in grocery, according to Nielsen, and continued strength in eCommerce.
Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 6%, resulting in a strong two-year stack comp of 16%. Sales strength was
broad-based across channels, with eCommerce sales growth of 37%.

The omni strategy continues to resonate, as customers utilize all the shopping options we offer, and we continue
to expand pickup and delivery capacity from stores. Customer trip consolidation led to a nearly 10% increase in
average basket size with 3% fewer transactions. Strong sales trends were led by apparel, home and lawn and
garden. Grocery sales declined against a uniquely tough comparison, but comps were up low double digits on a
two-year stack basis, including mid-teens growth in food categories held by strong price positioning, improving in-
stocks and expanded store hours relative to last year.

We're pleased with the progress of strategic growth initiatives, such as Walmart Connect Advertising, eCommerce
Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. Advertising revenue is robust, with triple-digit growth for the
quarter. Gross profit rate was strong, up more than 140 basis points, reflecting favorable mix shift to higher
margin general merchandise categories and lower markdowns. Margins were also helped by lapping last year's
COVID-related closures of business centers and auto care centers.

SG&A expenses deleveraged 49 basis points, as increased associate wage investments and increased
technology spend were partially offset by an approximate $400 million reduction in COVID-related costs versus
last year. Operating income was very strong, [ph] up (16:34) nearly 27%. Inventory increased 16%, reflecting
strong sales growth and lapping last year's COVID-related effects on inventory. We continue to monitor industry
challenges related to transit and port delays, and our merchants have taken steps to mitigate the challenges
including adding extra lead time to orders.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                   18-May-2021

The fundamentals of the U.S. business continue to improve, and we're confident we have the strategy, structure
and people in place to serve customers and reach our goals this year and beyond.

International delivered strong Q1 results, with net sales growth of 5.1% in constant currency, including strength in
India, Canada and China, despite many markets being negatively affected toward the end of the quarter by a
resurgence of COVID. The benefit of strategic portfolio realignment to focus on higher growth markets is
becoming more evident in top line growth. ECommerce sales increased approximately 64%, and penetration grew
more than 570 basis points to about 16% of sales. Currency benefited sales by approximately $0.7 billion.

Comp sales in Mexico declined slightly against a tough comparison, but were up low double digits on a two-year
stack basis as the omnichannel strategy continues to accelerate. The Mexico business has made good progress
expanding alternative revenue and profit streams within the ecosystem, including doubling the number of digital
advertisers and continuing to see strong growth in mobile services.

Canada comps increased 3.4%, with more than 115% growth in eCommerce sales, despite headwinds later in the
quarter from COVID-related government restrictions on the sales of nonessential categories like apparel and
general merchandise.

China comps increased 1.3% and were up 13% on a two-year stack. Strong Chinese New Year sales, continued
strength of Sam's Clubs and eCommerce growth of 60% all contributed to the result. Flipkart continues to perform
well, driving strong and sustainable eCommerce GMV growth and strong trends in monthly active customers and
users, even as the teams deal with the challenges [ph] of resurging (18:22) COVID cases in India.

International operating income was strong, up more than 21%, as better sales mix and fewer markdowns in
certain markets benefited margins in addition to continued focus on expenses.

The momentum at Sam's Club continued in the first quarter, with comp sales growth of 10.6%, excluding fuel and
tobacco, due, in part, to stimulus spending. On a two-year stack basis, comps were up nearly 27%. Comps
benefited from both increased ticket and transactions. Strength was broad-based across categories, with home
and apparel leading the way.

ECommerce sales were strong, increasing 47%, led by strength in curbside pickup at the Club. We're pleased
with the continued strong membership trends, as membership income grew about 13%. We achieved a new high
for overall membership counts during the quarter and saw higher renewal rates, including strong first-year
renewals and rising Plus penetration. Operating income increased more than 16% in Q1, but excluding the
negative impact of fuel, profit increased 33%.

Now, let's turn to guidance. Our typical practical is to not update guidance until the second quarter release, but
we're in an unusual period where Q1 stimulus led to meaningful sales and profit tailwinds that weren't
contemplated when we provided guidance in February. The guidance discussed here assumes that COVID
conditions continue to improve and there won't be significant additional government stimulus packages for the
remainder of the year.

We now anticipate higher full-year enterprise sales growth than originally projected, primarily due to the strong Q1
performance and our initial forecast for Q2. Excluding the impact of divestitures, consolidated net sales growth is
now expected to be up low to mid-single digits versus our original guidance of low single-digit increase. We're
also raising full-year guidance for operating income and EPS to reflect the strong performance in Q1 and our
expectation for a potentially better second quarter than previously expected.


                                                                                                                     8

Q1 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                                                                                                                                    18-May-2021


On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of divestitures, we now expect full-year consolidated
operating income to increase by high single digits for the year and EPS to increase by low double digits, which is
an increase from our prior guidance of both being flat to up slightly.

Walmart U.S. operating income is now expected to increase high single digits versus our original guidance of a
slight increase. The second quarter started off a bit better than originally anticipated, as stimulus spending
continues to benefit certain general merchandise categories, and we expect grocery market share gains to
continue. We now anticipate Q2 EPS, excluding divestitures, will be up low single digits and it assumes a low
single digit Walmart U.S. comp sales increase, excluding fuel.

The COVID pandemic continues to create both tailwinds and headwinds for our business. While Q1 was aided by
stimulus spending, primarily in the U.S., certain international markets continue to be negatively affected by the
resurgence in COVID cases and related government restrictions and operations, particularly in India and Canada.
Given continued uncertainty, we're maintaining our original guidance for the back half of the year, and we'll
update you as we gain clarity on key external variables related to the health crisis and their potential impact on
our business and the global economy.

Again, I'm very pleased with the first quarter results and feel good about the underlying strength of the business.
Thank you for your time and interest this morning and we'd be happy to take your questions.

Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to focus on growth rate because you've obviously mentioned that a couple times
just in this conference call and the presentation. But I guess what I'm wondering is what is your approach to
pricing, given the price gaps that we're seeing with conventional and that combined with the fact that we're seeing
unprecedented cost inflation? And I guess maybe asking it a little differently, with respect to your broader goals
for 2021, how important is recapturing share in grocery?

Hey, good morning. This is John Furner. Thanks for the question. First, let me just start by saying a big thank you
to our associates and our team around the country who helped us deliver the quarter. And on the heels of such an
interesting year last year, they've done a great job improving conditions, both in store and online, and we're really
proud of their performance in food. Glad to start with that question.

Over the quarter, we've seen a lot of progress in food with our inventory, considering we started the quarter with a
very large ice storm that affected supply chains. And then, as we noted, late in the quarter, performance that
resulted in market share gains in food. There is a view of this that we showed back in February, which is our
flywheel. And the top of the flywheel is our food and consumable business and our Supercenter business, which
is really important to the customer journey. And over the last 12 months, specifically on your question on price,

over the last 12 months, we saw our price gaps improve versus the market. And our merchants are working hard
to ensure that that will continue.

These market share gains that we saw in the latter part of the quarter are very encouraging. And it's great to see
that we're positioned well when customers need to shift. When customers shifted last year to shopping online, we
were able to perform at that time. And then, we've seen some shift back into store in the quarter and the
performance is represented in the first quarter is a reflection of that. So we feel good about the price gaps. These
are things that you always work on, considering how many levers merchants have and everything going on in the
market. But we feel good about our position in the market, and we'll continue to focus on share gains the rest of
the year.

Hey, Paul. This is Brett. Good to hear from you. Yeah, as we got through the first quarter and we started
understanding how strong the underlying business is – as John said, it started out a little challenging with the
weather we had in February. But we saw the business strengthening as we went through the quarter, And,
certainly, some of that is going to be stimulus. We readily admit that. But you're seeing customers get back out
again because it feels like things are opening back up, particularly in certain parts of the country. So we felt like it
was the right time to go ahead and update guidance different than we typically do, given the strong performance.
And then, what we've seen in the early parts of the second quarter, we felt that we should go ahead and update
guidance as we did.

We haven't said anything really about the back half. As I said in my comments, still a lot of uncertainties that are
out there with headwinds and tailwinds and they'll play themselves out over the next several months. But I think all
of us feel more confident than we did in February and felt like updating guidance was the right thing to do at this
point.

Thank you. And just a really quick follow-up. Just on the margins, just digging a little bit more in 1Q, Brett, could
you talk a little bit more about what was the impact of the strategic wage and technology investments that you
made?

Gross margins obviously were up significantly in the U.S. about 140 basis points. We had really strong general
merchandise sales this year comparing that against a quarter last year that was very heavily influenced by food
and consumables, so you get that dynamic on gross margin. Certainly the wage investments had an impact. I
won't get into the specifics of that. It did cause us, primarily caused us deleverage in the first quarter, but we knew
that was coming. We're glad we did that and certainly ahead of the environment you're seeing right now, wage
increases, tech increases as well. But it's offset by some other things that we're leveraging across the company.
Paul, I still feel good about the overall expense discipline and focus that I see across the company. And, as we
said, when we get through this year with the increased wage investments going forward, I still feel good about our
ability to leverage long term.

Hi, good morning, everyone. So I have maybe two-part question, but I'll make it one question. First, you referred,
Doug and Brett, in the transcript a lot of mentions of alternative profit streams or profit pools. Can you talk about
your visibility around the business and if these pools are giving you more confidence in sort of how you're
managing the business, it gives you more I guess wherewithal to invest back into it? And then the second part of
the question is, Doug, you mentioned the flywheel and you're investing in capacity ahead of growth. Any update
on when there could be an inflection? Or is it rolling? Or does it start at some point in the next fiscal year where
you're at a good place and maybe push a little bit harder on Walmart+? Thank you.

Yeah, Simeon, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to alternative profit pools, John can chime in here as well. But
I'm excited about Marketplace. I'm excited about what's happening with fulfillment services. Walmart Connect
performance was good. We do have strong visibility into that. And you're starting to see it happen in Mexico, too.
And as we've said to you before, this strategy makes sense for us everywhere in our key markets. So the P&L
starting to change its shape, as we described in February, even more than a year ago, and that does give us
some room.

Good morning, Simeon. This is John. I'll just add on and say that we are excited about the three areas you
mentioned: Marketplace; WFS, Walmart Fulfillment Services; and Connect, like we said earlier. Really optimistic
about the results with Walmart Connect with triple-digit growth. That platform is something that we've been
working on for a while. And, as we talked to you a few months ago, it helps connect buyers, sellers and suppliers
in a way that's unique to Walmart and optimistic about what we see there.

On fulfillment services, it's great to see the team expanding capacity. We know we have seller demand. My team
and I have spent a number of hours listening to sellers, talking to sellers and figuring out all the tools that we need
to add. So this is important for their businesses as well. And then, as we said in the quarter, we had 37% growth
in eCommerce on top of a big number last year. We've basically doubled the business the last couple years. So
excited about all three of those, and they're clearly businesses that will help us with our flywheel going forward.

As it relates to capacity getting ahead of growth, it's starting to happen. The plan that we had for the year is being
executed. And as you're in stores, you can see the stress that some of our stores are under in terms of the
volume going through for pickup and delivery orders. And in some stores, we're expanding space. Capital is going
towards that. In some stores, we'll be putting in automation to really press the top end of this thing, where we
know we're going to have that kind of demand, and the team's executing against that. And we continue, Simeon,
to be excited about it. And we'll go as fast as we can go this year and do it well, and I think we'll learn a lot from it.
And we're very confident that that capacity is going to be needed.

Hey. Good morning. Just a couple questions. I mean, largely around gross margin and pricing and inflation, just
wondered if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the inflationary side, different categories. And you
did mention balancing between customers and shareholders. Just sort of how you're approaching that and sort of
tying it together when you look at the consumer focused more on value versus convenience, just wondered if you
could maybe give us a few examples on where you think you're making progress around that value offering in this
environment. Thanks.

Yeah, thanks for the question. This is John again. First, as we said, we're really pleased with the performance in
food and the team has just done a great job getting the entire supply chain back in stock, including stores. We've
got changes in the stores where we're shifting more of our stocking to overnight, so we can free up more capacity
during the day for things like picking, as Doug said, and do that in a way that's conducive to customer shopping,
so excited to make those changes.

As far as price gaps, we've always had a principle here that Every Day Low Price is important. In the quarter, we
had about 30% more Rollbacks in stores than what we would have had a year ago. Some other things that are

important are the mix. Not only the mix of the entire box, but the mix within food. Pleased with the share gains that
happened in meat and produce and bakery. So even within the food categories, the mix has been favorable to
categories that tend to have better margins, which is enabling us to maintain price positions that we've been
running. And our gap expanded last year versus the market. We are pleased with the gap. We're proud of the
gap. And we'll continue to use all the levers we can to maintain those kinds of price gaps.

The merchants at Walmart this year are even more prepared than years in the past to be able to manage that
because of the channels they mix. Our merchants across the business can manage the channels from stores, to
eCommerce first party, eCommerce third party. And then, finally, with the additional revenue and profit streams
we mentioned with Walmart Connect, Marketplace and fulfillment services, that will just help us going forward mix
to make sure that we have the right gap for customers.

I do agree with you that value could be more important than convenience last year, but value has been an
important pillar of ours for a very long time.

This mentality that John described related to Rollbacks is important to underline. It applies in International. It
applies in Sam's Club as well. Bob, I'm reminded of a conversation in the early 1990s. As an assistant buyer in
food, my supervisor walked into the room with a few of us and said, we're short on our profit number for the
month. I need you all to find price reductions that you can put in place quickly. Bring them to me by the end of the
day. And I thought I misheard him. How do you lower prices and increase profit? And that's the beauty of retail
and of mix and these Supercenters and now with eCommerce and Marketplace and fulfillment services and
Walmart Connect, we've got all these levers to be able to find places to go upstream, do things differently than
other people are doing it. So to have 30% more Rollbacks in place right now in Walmart U.S., for example,
positions us really well.

Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking our question. I know that in-stocks was an area that you mentioned during 2020
that was hard to manage, given the strong demand. Just wondered currently are there any areas within your

Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Certainly, 2020 was a challenge when it comes to inventory flow
with all the phases we went through from the stock-up phase to people moving into their home and then demand
and supply chain challenges all across that were related to the pandemic. Early in the quarter, I felt like we were
making pretty good progress. And then, we had this ice storm, where we had just a record number of locations

certainly we see improvements in our food and consumable business compared to what they would have been a
year ago.

In general, general merchandise has been a bit mixed. It's better in many cases, but there are some pockets
where we continue to chase demand, things like adult bicycles, some of our categories in consumer electronics.
We're monitoring things like delays at the ports and other factors in the supply chain, and we'll watch all those
things closely to continue to react. But definitely some pockets in general merchandise that we're still chasing,
even as we speak today.

Good morning, guys. I just had a question on U.S. eCommerce, maybe for John. Just obviously the pickup activity
continues to scale, but just curious on the home delivery front, maybe what you're pushing on there, just any
updates and also your micro or market fulfillment center tests. Just curious kind of how you're approaching that
and just your thoughts on kind of the home delivery side of fulfillment of eCommerce. Thanks.

President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                             A
Sure. Sure. Peter, thanks for the question. In general, we have been working on capacity improvements and
capacity growth when it comes to online pickup and delivery from stores. That's something that we have been
tackling for some time now. It accelerated last year. And we managed things what we call things like slot
utilization or available slots, and we have more slots available for picking for scheduled orders than we've ever
had. We also have more capacity to ship from store, which leads to I think the second part of your question, which
is the in-home or the delivery at home.

And I'd say a couple things there. And number one, we are expanding our what we call our Walmart InHome
services, which we just picked up another market. And that's where we deliver food and other items from stores
all the way into the home, including in the refrigerator. We have our market fulfillment centers that you asked
about. We have several that are in construction. We expect to be launching those either late Q2 or early Q3, so
we'll be able to talk about that more once those launch.

And then, finally, we are excited about our last mile business. We've been operating our first delivery vans that
are Walmart branded in a market here in Arkansas and we're learning a lot as we go forward. But we see lots of
opportunities to serve customers, whether it's in store, it's at their home, or it's at the curb and they want to do
pickup.

We want to be extremely flexible and be able to serve customers any way they want. Last year, there was such a
shift of people that were wanting to have deliveries shifted at home from shopping in store. I think what we'll see
more this year is a balance between the at-home deliveries, shopping in store and pickup as people get back out.
But, as Brett alluded to earlier, that's assuming that conditions with the pandemic continue to improve. And we'll
be ready, should things change in either direction.

Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you quantify two of the comments that you made in the
script? One was from Brett. He noted that the guidance increase was mostly due to stimulus-related spending.
So how do you parse out the 1Q results and what you're expecting in 2Q, the impact from the stimulus in 2Q?
And Doug noted that Walmart+ is an important driver over time. So can you give us a sense for where that
program stands today and how it should unfold from here? Thank you so much.

Hi, Michael. This is Brett. Good to hear from you. Yeah, I mean, a couple things I mentioned in various ways in
the script is the underlying business feels good, and we're more optimistic about that part of it. Certainly, stimulus
benefited our results in the first quarter. But you can also get a sense of how we increased the second quarter.
You know what the original guidance was and how we increased the guidance for that quarter. So that should
give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about stimulus versus the underlying business.

I can tell you, though, it is challenging to pick out exactly the impacts of stimulus because of the types of
categories that you see benefited by stimulus are also categories you see benefited by the economy opening up,
particularly on the general merchandise side. So it makes it a little more challenging to pick through that.

Michael, on membership, inside Walmart, this is a new program for us. The number one driver of selling
memberships is the grocery Supercenter pickup and delivery. And, as we said before, capacity is our issue there.
And, as we said in February, our focus is on the quality of that experience, not the quantity. We want some time to
work on NPS. We want to build capacity. We are marketing the program. And long term, it'll be important to us.
But we've gotten so many other things going on, with stores improving in traffic and eCommerce growing and
Marketplace and all that kind of stuff, we don't think that Walmart+ should be the primary focus at the moment for
us with all these other opportunities. So we'll keep growing it.

At some point, I'm sure we'll share some more information with you guys about it. I know there's a request for that
because of streaming services and how much people are talking about subscriptions and memberships these
days. So that's – John, I don't know if you want to add anything, but that's how I feel about it right now.

Yeah, I completely agree. And the big thing that we're doing is creating capacity to be able to serve more and to
begin work on market fulfillment centers, where we can use locations as hubs for other stores and spokes. We've
got a lot of really encouraging supply chain work going on that would help us use the right algorithms to be able to
pull inventory from all across the network and be able to serve people. So encouraging just in the last few months
to see that not only the capacity has gone up, but eCommerce results have been strong, delivery from stores has

been strong, delivery from fulfillment centers has been strong. So these capabilities we're putting in place will be a

Having a digital relationship with customers is important, and that takes various forms. What we've seen with the
app downloads, for example, and app popularity and what happened last year in particular with pickup and
delivery, a really large expansion in the number of digital relationships, which helps us with data and helps us be
a retailer of the future. Overall, we feel good about what's happening in those areas.

Yeah, those relationships, I believe, will continue to grow because of things like the improvements in technology
we're working on, improving the app and its core experience, acquisitions like Zeekit and MeMD are also other
ways that customers will be able to connect with Walmart effectively, and we'll be able to help them with more and
more of their life and take friction out and make things simple for them.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We had a question on general merchandise improvements. You've talked a
lot about food, but I'd like to give you some time to talk about general merchandise. You've brought in new talent
there. You've made some strategic tuck-in acquisitions and some strategic partnerships as well. So help us think
about what we should be looking for in terms of progress on general merchandise. And maybe if you could tie that
back to some of your initiatives around Marketplace as well, what you're learning from your digital growth that
might be driving some of your in-store decisions around general merchandise. Thank you.

Sure. Let me take that one. This is John again. We're really excited about the performance in general
merchandise in the quarter. As you mentioned, we did make a number of changes with talent over the last year.
Probably the biggest change was last July, when we pulled all of the channels together. And traditionally, we had
teams of people we called category specialists that were online. And then we had buyers that were in store. And
we're referring to them all as merchants, because the merchants now have the customer relationship across all
channels. And the team has spent a lot of time thinking through and working on the right programs to determine
what in our assortment goes in store, what's 1P and then what's 3P.

I'll give you an example. Just last week, I was in Minneapolis visiting one of our suppliers, Nordic Ware, who
makes cookware here in the United States. And we went through the number of items that they have in stores,
what's doing well, what's going to improve. And then their entire catalog is available on the Marketplace. So our

merchants are able to manage the assortment across channels and that gives them more levers to be able to
serve the customer in a way that's frictionless and very clear.

But in the quarter, we definitely saw some changes with the way customers shop, partly due to stimulus, but also
just behavior changes. Brett talked about it earlier. Categories like personal care improving. Travel is starting to
really kick back in. And when you look at all the categories that are selling at Walmart, you can tell a lot about
what's going with customers across the country. So we definitely saw behaviors that are starting to reflect more
opening up and getting back out and going to see people.

Our Health & Wellness business has been extremely helpful at administering millions of vaccines in the quarter.
And then with some of the changes, even in the last week, we expect some of these changes with the customer
could continue, but we'll continue to watch that as the year moves on.

Hey, thanks for taking the question. Obviously, some very positive commentary on store traffic. I know you noted
that April saw an inflection. When you see that store traffic begin to really improve, are you seeing any other
changes within the eComm business, either pickup or delivery? And then as a follow-up, as that traffic improves,
are you seeing any favorable mix shifts? Thank you.

John R. Furner
President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                             A
So the traffic in store, the count of traffic, as we said, definitely changed in April. Probably late March a bit. That's
when we started to cycle some of the really big stock-up trips and what was happening last year were fewer trips
and big consolidation. It did put a lot of strain and stress on inventory and things like paper goods and food and
consumables.

So this year, as that shift began to occur and we saw the share numbers begin to reflect gains in the food
categories, I think it was a combination of people getting back out in comparison to last year but also some
normalization in terms of the frequency of food that's purchased.

Specifically within channels, strong growth between all three, as we said, in the U.S. The total comp was 6%,
including eCommerce growth of 37%. And then the eCommerce growth is a mix of what's being shipped to
people's homes from fulfillment centers or stores and inclusive of pickup.

Finally, I'd just say that we continue to expand capacity in all channels. We're excited about the expansion of slots
available for shopping in stores. We're excited about the amount of capacity we have in stores to ship to people's
home. And then, we're continuing to work and invest in the supply chain to have more capacity going forward for
pure first party eCommerce.

Thanks, guys. Just two follow-ups, if I could. One, the 100 basis point or so gross margin improvement, can you
sort of parse that out and how much is coming just from the mix from general merchandise and how much is
being supported by the strength in the alternative businesses and if not an exact quantification, maybe
directionally? And then the second question, just to follow up on the comp guidance, so first quarter was better
than expected. Second quarter guidance is up. Yet the full year comp, if I'm understanding it correctly, didn't
change. So should we read into something – is that a decline in the back half? Or just too early to change it? Or
low single digits is a pretty wide range, I suppose. It could be anywhere between 1% and 3% or 4%. So what do
we read into that, not changing the full-year guidance? Thank you.

Hey, this is Brett. Appreciate the question. Yeah, I think on the – I'll start with the second one on comp guidance.
What you said about low single digits being a fairly wide range, that is the case. It is a wide range and when you
look at the big numbers of Walmart U.S., it ends up in a really wide range. So I wouldn't read anything into that.
We feel great about the first quarter. And the second quarter started out pretty well, as we've said.

On gross margin, I'll say – start, John, you can come in – the biggest change, of course, was the general
merchandise sales strength that we're seeing this year versus the food and consumables strength that we saw
last year in the first quarter. And also when you start seeing strength in general merchandise, which we've had
really over the last several quarters, you see fewer markdowns. There's a lot of add-on benefits that come from
that for gross margin.

John R. Furner
President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                             A
Yeah, let me just add a bit on to the margin question. Certainly, there was strength in general merchandise in the
quarter. We talked about the strength in food. And food was more balanced this year than what we would have
seen last year. Last year, we were really heavy in dry grocery and stock-up items as the pandemic began.

So the strength in share gains that we saw in the first quarter in food, I think, most specifically, meat, produce,
bakery and grocery, but leading in the fresh areas is certainly helpful.

And the third point I think I'd make is inventory positioning at the end of the quarter. Our inventory level is up,
which is a good thing. Last year, we had big stock-outs in grocery and in general merchandise, so I feel much
better about our inventory position. As Brett mentioned, our inventory is clean and we've been really disciplined
about ensuring that we're clearing up end of season and seasonal, so we feel great there.

And then, the last thing I would say is the drivers of eCommerce contributed profit rates have been strong. Having
merchants in the position of having all channels [ph] in their re-mix, given a (49:55) category and what the
customer wants is helping with the drivers of eCommerce, which would include things like contributed profit rates,
Walmart Connect, et cetera.

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Also wanted to touch a little bit on general merchandise. So
with – in the U.S. So with low 20% growth, just curious if you think you gained market share there. We were
thinking maybe 26% market growth, which is kind of rough estimate, but just curious how you're thinking about
that, how you measure that. And also how your efforts with Walmart Fulfillment Services and third party are
maybe contributing to your general merchandise growth.

This is John. Let me take your first question first. The share performance in general merchandise, we think, is
about flat to last year. And we manage it a month in arrears. Our data is for February and March, so we feel good
about the performance through the first two-thirds of the quarter. Certainly saw, as you said, strength across
general merchandise in the 20% range. So I think we're positioned well, feel good about where the share is
versus a year ago, particularly excited about performances in categories like home and apparel in the quarter and
the positioning we have going into the second quarter.

Certainly some tightness in the supply chain, as we mentioned earlier, in select categories where we've had high
demand and stresses in the supply chain. But we're watching that carefully and feel good about the improvements
in in-stock all across the business, including the fulfillment centers and stores. But again, I think we're most
encouraged by the demand in seeing things like travel and other things open up and being able to be ready for
customers is important as we move forward.

And then, the second part of your question on fulfillment services, we've done a number of capacity improvements
that are coming online this year. So we're excited about the impact those will have not only on the top line and for
the customer, but also for our sellers. Our sellers are looking for more services and ability to ship, and it's a great
way to enable small businesses for growth. So as the year goes on, we'll see more and more capacity come
online for our fulfillment service business.

Good morning, guys. My question is on the U.S. EBIT increase that you saw. I'm wondering how much of that
increase was attributable to what I would assume is a structurally more profitable eCommerce operation, given
that the growth in scale you were able to garner last year. And related to that, any updated color regarding the
profitability run rate of eCommerce today?

President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                             A
Good morning, Scot. This is John. Specifically, on your question on eComm, we feel good about the drivers of the
eComm profitability, which is contributed profit rates and that would be gross margins less the cost of shipping.
We also feel good about the alternative revenue streams that are included in eCommerce, which are things like
the Marketplace, fulfillment services. Like I said earlier, we're expanding capacity and we know we have seller
demand. And we're really proud of the triple-digit growth in Walmart Connect. So all of those added together are
helpful in the eCommerce P&L.

On the breakout, we actually are not breaking out the difference in stores and eComm because it has just become
so blurred. As we've transitioned to an omni business, we have our merchants that are overseeing all channels by
category. Stores are acting as stores, they act as pickup centers and, in some cases, fulfillment centers. We have
fulfillment centers acting as fulfillment centers, which go direct to home and at times they ship to a store, so the
inventory can be consolidated with an order and then put into our last mile network.

So it's just not possible for us to break those out, given how blurred the lines have become. But overall, I'd say the
team are doing – they're just doing a great job with the contributed profit rates and the mix within – not only the
mix within the business like general merchandise versus other things, but within categories, they're doing a great
job improving contributed profit rates.

Hey, good morning, and great quarter here. More of a macro question for me. When you look at the data and see
how the consumer has allocated these most recent stimulus checks, I'm curious how they compare and contrast
to what you saw in April and late December of this past year. Are they still spending at the same amount? Or are
we seeing more allocated to savings and, therefore, there's some pent-up demand that could get spent in the
coming months?

Hey, Chuck, this is Brett. Yeah, I think we're seeing a little bit of both. You're seeing customers definitely get out
and spend again. The spending rates are good. Income rates are good. But savings rates are actually still almost
at an all-time high, which would lead you to believe that there is going to be some pent-up demand as we get to
the back half of the year. So in a lot of ways, the consumer balance sheet, unless you're in certain industries that
were really impacted by COVID, the consumer balance sheet is about as strong as it's been. Now, a lot of that is
due to the stimulus, the money that's gone into the economy that way. But in either case, it would indicate that
there's some demand coming.

Hey, good morning, guys. Doug, you mentioned the omnichannel Health & Wellness business. Can you remind
us what that can ultimately look like? And maybe weave in what the current like pharmacy recovery, how that's
playing out? I know you guys have been involved with vaccines and everything. Anything going on that's going to
accelerate the omnichannel healthcare dream for you guys?

Yeah, Robby, I'll jump in first, and then John can add. I think the pharmacy business has performed really well,
considering everything our pharmacists have been doing. It's been an incredible challenge to do everything that
they've done since the pandemic started, including all of these vaccinations that they're doing. We did have to
shut down our vision centers for a while. Optical, though, is back open, and that's helped a lot. The ultimate
destination does look like an omnichannel destination, where we leverage those historical businesses together
with new healthcare services and the digital front-end that John mentioned earlier and I mentioned in my remarks
with MeMD.

You can imagine a future where we'll be able to reach customers on their devices, in their homes, to help them
think about their healthcare in terms of what they eat, how much they move and then what types of healthcare
services they need and where they get them. And so I think you can see us building together those capabilities
that would help people have access to care, more of an outcomes-based healthcare system, great value,
accessibility and serve a lot of people that need to be served and also end up with a really good business that fits
together well with a large food retailer. And so we've just been working through that strategy, executing the
pieces. And if you look back at the CareZone acquisition, this latest acquisition of MeMD, you can see us adding
some capabilities in addition to those that we're building on our own.

Robby, this is John. I just want to reiterate excitement for the idea of an omnichannel healthcare solution for
customers and Walmart together. Our pharmacists and our pharmacies have performed very well in the last year,
given all the challenges they face. They've opened up curbside delivery, delivery to home. We've got

Central Fill Pharmacies now helping assist with costs and efficiency. And the service suite that they offer is, of
course, different by state, but the way our teams jumped in and found ways to help get the country vaccinated has
been nothing short of amazing. I was in a store here locally last night and just seeing a number of people be able
to walk up and get their vaccine was very encouraging.

And then, as Doug said, the market changed last year. We had opened a number of clinics and we continue to
open clinics. We're excited about the prospects that clinics bring. And then, a large part of healthcare shifted to
digital last year and the entire industry embraced that. So this acquisition of MeMD to enable relationships with
customers on their device, in their home and be able to execute service care with our pharmacies and clinics on
the back side of that is a really exciting prospect and it's big part of our flywheel going forward.

Just want to close by saying thank you to all of you for following the company so closely. Hopefully, you can see
that in addition to the U.S. tailwind, that we've got strength building in the company. As I mentioned, I was in a lot
of stores during this last quarter. And standards are improving, in-stock's improving against the challenges that
obviously the pandemic brought. But we've also got great momentum and strength in Sam's Club. International
had a really good quarter, one of the best quarters, Brett, we've had in a while in International. And the portfolio
work that Judith and the team have been doing there is working.

And the situation with the virus in India is tragic. And we'll support not only our own folks, but the country as much
as we can to try and get through that. And I'm sure there will be other hot spot cities and countries that we'll deal
with in the coming weeks because this pandemic is not over.

But pandemic aside, economic stimulus aside, our focus is on the input metrics, the underlying fundamentals, the
capabilities that we're adding. And we see ourselves making real progress against those. The company has
changed a lot and there's more change coming. And I'm grateful to the team and excited about the future. Thank
you, all.
