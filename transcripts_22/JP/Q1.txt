big expansion bank deposits wide expansion tail end cycle rrp come rrp gotten sort quite big qe finished look potentially kind running whole thing reverse might actually expect first thing would happen rrp would get drained later would bank deposits start shrink think correctly point nuances fed minutes sort combine effects together realize theres lot interacting forces really think intelligent people differ predictions whats going happen outline couple worth noting starters general industrywide loan growth outlook quite robust tailwind systemwide deposit growth note yeah qt start may likelihood per minutes headwind look whats going happen front end curve particularly bills treasury make decisions weighted average maturity makes sense theres obviously little bit shortage shortdated collateral market right might argue wanting supply fed make decisions portfolio management talked minutes using bill maturities fill gaps forth things going interact various ways think one thing thats worth noting though wind state world bank deposits drain sooner people might otherwise thought likelihood thats going lower value nonoperating type deposits case well see simplify second base case remains modest growth deposits us company pivoting away second system us share perspective weve taken share retail deposits feel great wholesale weve nice wins nice pipeline deals thats current thinking topic jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co answer dont know okay guys read economists reports fact initially probably wont come deposits time come wholesale
