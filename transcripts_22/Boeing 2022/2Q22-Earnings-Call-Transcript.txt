President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.
...interruption there. Start over? Okay. Sorry, we were muted. It's good to be with all of you. Thanks, Matt, for the
intro. I want to start my brief comments upfront with just a revisit at the Farnborough Airshow little over a week
ago. It was important for us. It was an emotional outcoming for our company and our people. We always work a
little better when we are standing next to our products and the flight teams who are operating them. It was great to
see, and I think everyone witnessed the 777X in flight, which was more than magnificent. The dash-10 also in
flight and our investment in Wisk and its product in the important eVTOL market. We met with our customers. We
met with suppliers, partners, the usual, except it didn't feel like the usual because it had been a while.

We're proud of the orders that we collected over the course of that week, over 200 orders and commitments. And
importantly, it covered the whole line, the 737 MAX, our 787, and the 777X. And it shows the extent to which our
airline customers are already anticipating fleet renewal projects and their willingness to bet forward on that
prospect. Needless to say, they're all as busy as they can be, trying to get their own fleets up and running and the
supply constraints they face dealt with.

Looking at the quarter, a lot of things good happened over the quarter. We are on the verge of returning to the
787 delivery process. I won't give a date. I never have. That's up to the FAA. But we've been working closely with
our customers and the regulator on those final steps. We're proud of our team. We're proud for the discipline and
the detailed work they applied over this long course. And it will be worth it. In the end we'll have a predictable and
high-quality line, and our customers will be pleased with the products. And a reminder to everyone that this 787
fleet that's out there has been working harder than it's ever worked and it's been performing incredibly well.

Turning to the MAX, again, one airplane at a time, the fleet is performing incredibly well, oftentimes exceeding the
specification and expectations our customers had when they originally placed their orders. And we continue to
work hard on predictability of the delivery chain. And we're focused mostly on the engine supply lines and then
those second-tier constraints that those engine suppliers are facing.

And I think we've made an awful lot of progress on that front. Brian will give you a sort of our best guess at how
this year turns out with respect to those deliveries, but it's now I think based on far better knowledge of what those
supply constraints are and commitments from our supply side engine suppliers.

In BDS, I don't want to skip over the Starliner. It was important. It was an emotional up for all of us at Boeing to
get back on track. We had a wet dress for the Space Launch System rocket, the biggest rocket yet. We're looking
forward to that launch. So we had a good sort of engineering coming out with respect to those achievements. And
yes, we're still working through some of the challenging macro environment issues especially with respect to our
fixed price development contracts, and Brian will also walk you through that.

And then finally, on the services side, like pretty much everyone that's been reporting, it is coming back and it's
coming back in a rapid way. Our commercial service business was up 30%. It carries strong margins with it. And
so it was a big and important contributor to our overall cash flow story.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                     27-Jul-2022

And again, the result of all of this work, a big step forward with respect to stability, we did get to cash flow
operating cash flow positive. So that puts us a little bit ahead of our internal plan and we feel good about that. And
we are still committed to be cash flow positive for the calendar year 2022.

It's underpinned by a very strong commercial market. I think you all know that. Everyone spoke to it. A lot of
supply constraints out there with respect to the operators of our airplanes, the airlines and what they've got to do
to get the fleets running efficiently and build their capacity where it needs to be. But they are out there in the
market trying to rebuild their fleets for the future and to meet that significant demand. And so far we've not seen
any drawback on that demand. While we understand sort of recession fears that are growing out there, so far it
has not impacted the aviation industry or our customers.

So mostly what we're focused on and I don't think it will surprise anyone and I think I've heard it in most of my
peers' reports is the supply chain, stabilizing it, making sure that it's predictable and consistent. And for us in
particular with respect to the commercial side of our business, it relates to engine production, engine availability,
so that we can predictably deliver airplanes to our customers. We think we've made an awful lot of progress on
that front. I know you've heard directly from the engine suppliers. They are making progress and we've adjusted
all of our delivery rate expectations, at least in the near-term, to satisfy those constraints.

A comment quickly on regulatory and geopolitical, I'll start with geopolitical, China. The good news is that because
of the strong demand in the marketplace, we've been able to manage our risk going forward with respect to the
airplanes that we have built and are awaiting delivery. We intend to stand by our Chinese airlines, stand by the
CAAC and get those airplanes back, but the timing which has been pushed and deferred in light of some of the
COVID management issues in China and some of that geopolitical overhang, we can suffer our way through that
and will, and it should not impact the cash flow positive posture that we've taken for the year.

So it's a little easier to manage for us. It's no less important. And we will continue to encourage our administration
to work as closely as they can with the Chinese to reopen the trade corridor with respect to aviation, a relationship
we've enjoyed for over 50 years, and we'll continue to support our customers. Medium- and long-term, it does
represent the difference between commercial air space leadership or not, given the size and scale of the China
market.

And then on the regulatory front, we are working constructively with the FAA. We have our heads down. We're
working towards certification by year-end on the dash-7 and the dash-10, and we believe what we're working on is
in fact the safe option with respect to all options in the narrowbody space, and so we're going to just keep
plugging away. And anyway, that's enough said.

As we navigate through this environment, stability is the watch word for all of us. We want to be predictable. We
think that will differentiate us. And that's why we're focused on it. We continue to increase our investment in
research programs, the readiness program with respect to the next big commercial airplane, all the digital
modeling tools that are required to be ready for that, we continue to invest aggressively in. And we continue to
enhance those underlying digital technologies that we will bring ultimately to the services market as well. Safety,
quality, transparency, these are values and this is what we remain focused on.

So before I turn it over to Brian, the MAX is on track and it's performing for customers, in many cases exceeding
expectations. We think we're through the most difficult parts of the COVID-19. Starliner, a pivotal and emotional
test for The Boeing Company and we feel good about it and we're ready for the crewed flight. Global Services on
its way back in a big way. We feel terrific about their progress. And now we are at the detailed moment to get
ready for 787 deliveries, a moment we've been waiting for, and we look and feel as though we're on the verge of

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Boeing Co.
Thank you, Dave, and good morning everyone. This was an important quarter. We made good progress on key
programs in a pretty dynamic macro environment affected by inflation, labor availability, and supply chain
constraints, all of which impacted both us and the industry.

Despite these challenges, we improved our quarter-over-quarter cash performance, and importantly, generated
positive operating cash flow. Cash was driven by higher commercial delivery volume as well as order activity and
advance payment timing. This keeps us on track to generate positive free cash flow for the year and higher cash
flows in 2023.

We still think about our performance in three parts and remain confident about the trajectory. First, as Dave
mentioned, we made progress on key milestones. We're nearing a return for the 787 and are preparing airplanes
for delivery. We continue to focus on 737 production stability of 31 MAXs per month and we've de-risked China
from our near-term delivery profile.

Next, as we see continued progress on these programs, we anticipate improvement in our performance metrics
including deliveries, revenue, margin, and cash flow in the back half of the year. We also expect cash flow
benefits from order activity and favorable receipt timing over the next two quarters.

Finally, our financial performance should start to accelerate into 2023. Going forward, there is a significant
opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth and we look forward to sharing our plans at our
Investor Day on November 1 and 2.

Before getting into the financials, I want to make a few points on the current business environment on slide 3.
Demand for commercial airplanes is strong especially in the freighter market. We've seen cargo traffic increase
from 2019 levels, largely driven by e-commerce and the efficiency of air freight. With more than 90% share of the
freighter market, our lineup is well positioned to capture continued growth.

On the passenger side, traffic has recovered significantly, but it's still well below where it's been historically
relative to global GDP. As airlines are currently in the middle of the summer high season, operational and supply
constraints are becoming the pacing item for air traffic growth and the markets leading the recovery. That said,
the commercial traffic recovery is accelerating and passenger traffic has reached its highest point since 2019 in
both North America and Europe.

Domestic traffic remains relatively stable at 77% of 2019 levels as of May. While China still lags significantly, we
saw some improvements in flight operation in June as travel restrictions lifted. Excluding China, domestic traffic
was over 90% of 2019 levels.

International traffic is gaining momentum at 64% of 2019, up from just 48% in March, especially in regional
markets such as intra-Europe, transatlantic, and US-Mexico, as well as notable improvements via the Middle East
and in some parts of Asia. Overall, our commercial passenger market recovery expectations are in line with what

we've shared previously. We still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024
timeframe.

Taking all this into consideration, we recently released our 2022 commercial market outlook which forecasts a
total addressable market valued at more than $3.3 trillion over the next decade and demand for nearly 20,000
airplanes. The forecast closely aligns to what we laid out last year and reflects the market's continued recovery.
More specifically, we anticipate demand for more than 14,000 narrowbodies or over 120 per month on average
over the next 10 years. From a 20-year perspective, we project demand for more than 41,000 new airplanes
including 940 dedicated freighters. We are very confident in our product lineup which is well suited to capture this
long-term demand and we feel very good about last week with over 200 orders and commitments at Farnborough.
We appreciate the trust and confidence our customers are placing in us.

Our services business also continues to benefit from growing commercial fleet and strong cargo markets, with
several Boeing Converted Freighter and materials management agreements recently announced. Over the next
10 years, we see a $3.3 trillion service market that aligns well with our broad customer-focused portfolio of
offerings.

In defense and space, we see solid long-term markets both domestically and internationally. In the United States,
there is support for increased defense spending in Congress to meet the challenges of today. Internationally,
many of our fellow NATO members, partners, and allies have announced plans for increased spending on
national defense and we look forward to more specifics around these priorities.

Turning to the supply chain, we continue to experience real constraints. We're taking action to mitigate risk in a
number of areas including engines, raw materials, and semiconductors. To stabilize production and support our
supply chain, we're increasing our on-site presence at suppliers, creating teams of experts to address industry-
wide shortages, utilizing internal fabrication for surge capacity, and managing inventory safety stock levels and
growing where needed.

With that backdrop, let's turn to financials on slide 4. Second quarter revenue of $16.7 billion declined 2% and we
generated $0.5 billion of core operating earnings. After accounting for interest expense and taxes, we had a core
loss per share of $0.37. Operating cash flow was positive $0.1 billion, in line with our expectations and an
improvement from the same period last year.

Let's move to Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Second quarter revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3%, primarily driven
by higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.2 billion and resulting
negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D expense as we continue
to invest in the business.

On the 787 program, we're very close to resuming deliveries. We're readying airplanes together with our
customers and have completed flight checks on the initial airplanes. As always, we will follow the lead of the FAA
on the specific timing.

We have 120 airplanes in inventory and are making progress completing the necessary rework to prepare them
for delivery. As stated last quarter, we're producing at very low rates and will continue to do so until deliveries
resume, gradually returning to five airplanes per month over time. Similar to the 737 program, the supply chain
remains a key watch item for 787 production and deliveries.

The Boeing Co. (BA)                                                                          Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                     27-Jul-2022

We recorded $283 million of 787 abnormal costs, in line with expectations, and we still anticipate a total of about
$2 billion, with most being incurred by the end of 2023. These costs are driven by rework and production rates
below five per month. It is important to keep in mind that cash margins on the 787 remains positive and are
expected to improve significantly over time. However, as we deliver the first few 787 airplanes, you may see some
variability in cash payments as we compensate customers for delays. The 787 continues to be the most utilized
widebody airplane due to its operational efficiency and flexibility. With over 400 airplanes in backlog, recent orders
and commitments announced at Farnborough, and additional demand as the commercial market recovers, we
see a strong future for the 787 program.

Moving on to the 737 program, we have delivered 189 airplanes year-to-date, below our original expectations due
to three things: supply chain disruptions, flow time of taking airplanes out of storage, and timing of deliveries to
Chinese customers. We don't anticipate making up those deliveries in the back half of the year and we'll continue
to experience monthly variability including a light month in July. We now expect deliveries to be closer to the low-
400s for 2022, short of what we discussed earlier this year, as we drive stability and predictability.

We entered the quarter with 290 MAX airplanes in inventory, of which roughly half are designated for customers
in China. Given this uncertainty with our customers in China, we now expect more deliveries of airplanes from
inventory to shift into 2024. Due to overall progress on MAX production, we did not book abnormal costs in the
quarter. Additionally, we've reached agreement on over 95% of our MAX customer consideration liability.

Shifting to the 777-9 program, our status is largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still
anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025 and continue to coordinate with the FAA to prioritize
resources across our development programs. We booked $102 million of 777 abnormal costs in the second
quarter, in line with our expectations, and we still expect to record $1.5 billion of these costs through 2023, while
777-9 production remains paused.

Turning to overall demand at BCA, during the quarter we booked 184 commercial airplane orders, including 169
orders for the 737 MAX. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 4,200 airplanes in backlog valued at $297
billion.

Let's now move on to Defense, Space & Security on slide 6. Second quarter revenue was $6.2 billion, down 10%,
driven by lower volume and operational performance. Operating margin was 1.1%, driven by approximately $400
million of charges on fixed price development programs, most notably $147 million on MQ-25 and $93 million on
Commercial Crew. This total also includes relatively small cost growth on the T-7A, Tanker and VC-25B, with no
one program impacted by more than about $50 million and the drivers were largely supply chain impacts and
inflation. All of this will be outlined in the Q.

We also saw these same pressures across a few of the mature programs. While this performance was
disappointing, we're making progress narrowing our development risk profile and remain confident over the long-
term.

We received $2 billion in orders during the quarter, and BDS backlog was $55 billion. Additionally, the Chinook
helicopter has been selected to bring heavy-lift capability to the German military.

We also achieved important milestones across the portfolio. NASA's Space Launch System completed the wet
dress rehearsal and the KC-46A tanker is now certified to refuel 97% of the military's air refuelable fleet.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                                                                                                                                       27-Jul-2022

Let's now turn to Global Services results on slide 7. The Global Services team celebrated its fifth anniversary this
month and continues to perform well, especially in our parts and commercial training businesses. We're
encouraged by the overall momentum. Second quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 6%, and operating margin
was 16.9%. Results were driven by higher commercial services volume now nearly back to pre-pandemic levels
and favorable mix. We also discontinued an engine distribution agreement in the quarter which will impact our
government service revenue profile going forward.

We received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, including a contract for airlift flight dispatch services for the US
Air Force, and a contract for avionics upgrades and cybersecurity support for the US Navy. The BGS backlog is
$19 billion. With strong support for our defense business and our highly-valued commercial capabilities, our
services business is poised for growth as the commercial market continues to recover.

Now let's turn to slide 8 to cover cash and debt. We ended the second quarter with strong liquidity comprised of
$11.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, and access to $14.7 billion across our bank
credit facilities which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased slightly from the end of last quarter to $57.2
billion, driven by repayment of maturing debt. Our investment grade credit rating is a priority and we remain
committed to reducing debt levels through strong cash flow generation over time.

As far as the rest of the year is concerned, we still anticipate 2022 total company revenue to be higher than last
year, primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 737 and 787 programs and growth in our
services business partially offset by lower defense revenue.

Looking into 2023, we expect total company revenue growth from this year. BCA revenue is planned to be higher,
again, on 737 and 787 deliveries. The demand outlook for the defense business remains steady and we expect
2023 revenue to be better than 2022 as the business stabilizes. While we forecast BGS revenue to continue to
grow next year, the growth rate will be tempered as we are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels.

Turning to cash, we still expect to generate positive free cash flow this year and the key drivers of second half
improvement are higher 737 and 787 delivery volume, orders of advance payments, BDS receipts, as well as
favorable expenditure timing. As we look to 2023, we still expect cash flow will be higher than 2022 and we plan
to share more details in November.

Overall, our performance is tied to several key items: supply chain, production system, and delivery stability, 737
and 787 delivery ramp, successful execution and certification of development programs, the commercial market
recovery, and the macroeconomic environment. While our progress depends on some factors beyond our control,
we'll remain focused on our own performance and taking the right action to drive stability and predictability and
growth in the future.

Taking a step back, this business and our team have come a long way over the last few years. We've seen our
fair share of challenges and more hurdles still remain, but we're making progress. Demand for our product is
strong, and we're investing in our future and our people are demonstrating exceptional commitment.

With that, over to Dave for closing comments.

Yeah, I'll keep them brief. We do believe we're in the middle of a momentum shift. We're all anxious and looking
forward to delivery of our important airplane, the 787. Again, a reminder of how well it is performing in the field
and therefore this delivery stream is critically important to our customers.

So I'll leave it with that, and turn it over to Q&A.

When you look to this year and are looking at positive free cash flow for the year, it appears to have really depend
heavily on two things, the delivery – restart of the 787 and the deliveries for the – the ramp in deliveries for the
MAX, which you're now saying you're going to get to the low-400s on this. If you look at those two parts, I mean,
the 787, could you describe on that one, what gives you confidence now that you are so close? W e've heard
things before, optimism about a near restart, but this appears to be much more imminent now, I would guess,
even though I know you're not going to try to predict the FAA's timing. So that's on the 787. And when you go over
to the MAX, you've taken that number down into the low-400s. Could you talk about what you need out of that
MAX profile to be on this positive cash flow timing? And then what's the split between stored and new production?
So, a lot of things there, but all in that positive free cash flow objective.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                                A
Yeah, Doug, so why don't I start with 787 predictability. So, like we said and like you acknowledged, we can't give
you a date, but what we do track is all the work and the issues that both teams have wrestled with over this time,
and we are approaching closure on all of that. The number of documents, the number of analyses, the number of
signoffs has progressed at a fairly rapid rate here towards the close. So we see that documentation phase, which
has been a lion's share of the phase, as closing relatively soon. And then therefore the readiness of airplanes,
which we have been working on exactly the same moments, simultaneously, has also been in shape to the point
where customers are climbing around the airplanes and making certain that they are also ready for delivery and
acceptance.

So, all that's coming together, and, yes, the FAA remains in control, but there's just enough workload on sort of
both fronts, readiness of the airplane and the documentation and certification requirement that we just feel like
we're on the verge and are reasonably confident in that front. So, that's why I feel different this time, and I will
acknowledge, Doug, that we have felt like it was near-term in previous periods, but not with the same level of due
diligence that I feel now.

On the MAX delivery front, let me turn it over to Brian. He's got all the numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                           A
Yeah, so thanks, Doug. So the low-400s we think the balance of the year will satisfy the cash flow requirements to
do their fair share of that total picture. So we think that's pretty well aligned.

In terms of what's coming out of inventory versus the production line, our biggest objective is on both fronts to do
both in a stable manner. And as you can see from our numbers, we've been doing about 10-ish out of storage this
last quarter. We continue to get a little bit better on that front. So that's something we're going to work hard on as
we turn the corner in the second half of the year, so both are very important. Doing both in a stable, predictable
manner gets to that low-400s for the year.

I will also indicate there's three really other important levers of the cash flows in the back half as a bridge from the
first half. You mentioned the big two, the 737 and the 787 deliveries, but there's also going to be favorability timing
from BDS receipts that will work to our favor, there will be favorability of expense timing that will accrue to us, and
there will be higher order activity and advanced payments particularly driven by the 777 adjustments that we
made last quarter. Remember, we added metal wing capacity and the launch of the 777-X freighter version, and
all those benefits are going to manifest themselves in helping the cash trajectory in the second half versus the first
half. So, those are the big pieces that we think about.

Analyst, Melius Research LLC                                                                                                                                                                                                               Q
Dave, you opened with the supply chain and the troubles there, and I have a specific supply chain question and
then something more general on rates.

Given your engine background from GE, how do we solve this casting shortfall that's now plagued the industry
twice in recent years, both now and I want to say around 2018? Is this a short-term cyclical issue, or is there a
greater structural problem? So that's the first question.

The second question, Brian touched on 2023 and the significance of the MAX and the 787 ramp. I wanted to see
if you could boundary the MAX production rate on the low and high end perhaps with – the trajectory, perhaps
with and without China?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                                A
So let me discuss the engine related. It is a very important issue to be resolved, and it is not yet resolved, that
structural casting part of the puzzle. You may recall two or three meetings ago at this I acknowledged that would
eventually be the issue and of course it is. So that capacity is limited. It's not just about money, it's qualification.
It's one of the toughest components inside the supply chain to ultimately get to a qualified status, as well as just
the sheer physical capacity to do it.

So I do think we all have to moderate our rates to make sure that we are ahead of that. And I do think the work
that we've done, unfortunately our choice not to move up to 38 here as soon as we had originally predicted is
honestly based on that constraint. But I do believe we're at a state now where at 31, we're comfortable the
industry can get there and maybe have already gotten there, and then we're going to watch as they qualify more
capacity going forward before we pull those rates up.

So, is it medium- and long-term? Somehow, some way that constraint in my view in the next three to five years
has to get solved itself. Some investment has to get made and capacity has to expand for the engine suppliers to
keep up with what I believe will be continued robust demand. So, this may not be a satisfactory answer, but I think
that is the reality of the world I've lived in for the last 20 years. And then with respect to the other parts of the
question, I'll flip it over to Brian again.

Yeah, for rate, production rate, I wouldn't worry about China. As Dave has and we've continually talked about, we
enjoy a pretty robust demand market. And the China delivery and when that happens is separate from our ability
to move rate given the other demand in the marketplace. So, I think I'd separate those two. It's not a pacing item.

No, I'll answer that. The answer is I don't know when that will happen. Stability at 31 and then confidence that
engine suppliers will have their castings in order and can predict steady delivery at 38, that will then initiate us to
say now it's 38. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Stability for me is still job one and that's what we'll stay
focused on. Do I think it will be better next year? Yeah. But I don't know exactly when and I don't want to get
ahead of myself.

Hey, good morning, Dave and Brian. Maybe if we could talk about commercial profitability. If we strip out the
abnormal costs from the 787 as well as the 777, you're at 2.3% operating margins in the quarter with an average
of 33 MAXs produced or delivered. So how do we think about how margins come back as maybe the 787 comes
in, the supply chain pressures alleviate? How should we look on to the step-up of commercial operating margins?
Thanks.

Yeah, so in the short-term, it will be a little bumpy as we start to roll out the 787s and continue to get confidence in
our stability in the 737s, but over time when we get to a point where both are stable and operating where we
expect them to, the margin is going to go up. I can't predict a number – I won't predict a number. But they are
going to get better and better because we are going to be more predictably and in a stable fashion be able to
deliver on both fronts, anyway.

I'm just going to circle back to this MAX delivery discussion, because it's a bit confusing. Depending on how you
define low-400, if I subtract the first half from that and divide it by six, it suggests the delivery pace would slow
compared to what you did in June, and that's with a higher production rate. So it suggests the inventory unwind is
slowing. So why would that happen?

And then just on this underlying rate, I mean, any supplier we talk to says they're kind of ready to go and just
waiting for direction from you that they're not getting. The leasing companies are saying there's a narrowbody
shortage. You have a competitor at a much higher rate. Is your answer to Rob's question that it's just purely
forgings and castings and otherwise you would be higher? It's a little hard to square the circle on all of those
inputs.

Before Brian gets in the – it's never about any supplier. It's about one or two that surprise you one way or the
other. And with respect to medium or longer term rate increases or changes, yeah, it does actually get down to
that engine supplier and it does get down to those castings. So, we have to be confident that they are ready and
that we can count on those deliveries. So anyway, that is the world we live in now.

And, Noah, June, we are proud of the 43 that we were able to deliver. I want to caution everyone if you
remember, April was 28, May was 29. I just indicated that July's going to be a little light. So, I don't want us to get
ahead of ourselves in terms of taking the June rate and extrapolating it. That would be a mistake. Month in and
month out, we're aiming at stability around 31, some months might be a little lower, some months might be a little

higher. When we look at the whole balance to go and the things we're watching, we feel comfortable in that low-
400 number. And hopefully it will be better, but that's right now what we're squaring to.

How much lead time do you feel like you need to give the broader supply chain to break to that next higher rate,
whenever that is?

Well, first of all, we're doing our very best to be transparent and we are always informing them when we get close.
How much lead time? I don't know, three or four months...

...if it's a formal designation. But I think they're all – like you said, I think a lot are prepared to get to those higher
rates, but we need a few specific ones to be ready to get to those higher rates. And sorry to keep coming back to
that, but that's really where it is. I think we have our eye squarely focused on the constraint that matters the most.
And as that plays out, you'll probably know as fast as I do, and then we'll let that go to the rest of the market. I
think the rest of the market will respond quickly.

Dave, Brian, wanted to see if you could tell us how many roughly 787 deliveries you're assuming for the rest of
the year, because it's pretty hard to kind of bridge sort of the positive free cash flow for the year without assuming
a fair amount of 787 deliveries in the last five months. That's my first question.

And then second question, you've talked about a meaningful improvement in free cash flow in 2023. I just want to
see if you could put some bounds around that. Are we talking a couple billion dollars? Or are we talking, you
know, the consensus right now is showing a $7 billion improvement in free cash flow next year. I wanted to see if
that's within the realm of reason. Thanks.

Yeah, sure. So, your last question, can't wait for November to be able to give you a more detail around that, and
we'll wait until November. And then on your question on the 787 number, we're not going to give a number on that
front. We want to get to one. And we're really excited to get to one as fast as we can, and once that plays out we'll
get more visibility. But it's a little too early to quantify that. Clearly we've got an expectation that we're going to
liquidate some 787s over the course of the second half, but I'm just a little cautious to stick a number out there.

All right. Quick follow-up, Dave, the IG Audit that's going on with the FAA and the change in leadership there, you
don't think that potentially holds up the 787s at all?

I do not. I do not. And I've also asked that question many times. So I think we're in a good place. Again, I'm going
to follow up just quickly with Brian's comment. We're not playing a game. We are working as hard as we can to
get to stability in a tough environment. We chose that November meeting as a moment to sort of say, okay, where
are we on stability, what is the framework for cash flow over the course of the next year? We're looking forward to
that day and that meeting, and I think at that moment in time a lot of these variables will have resolved
themselves and we can give you a much clearer view of what the future looks like.

Thanks very much, and good morning. I guess, Brian, when we look at the advances balance of $52 billion, I think
it's higher than it was at the end of 2018 when rates were significantly higher, and it sounds like you're telling us

that that balance is going to be even higher still, but perhaps significantly by December 31. Does that ever come
down at some point? How do we kind of think about where that goes from here? And Dave, when you say having
some visibility on some of these big questions at the November meeting, does that include potentially MAX
deliveries into China?

So, that balance did come down this quarter. And we do expect it to come down, it will. It will be the excess PDP
burndown that will come down, but it gets offset by the benefit of incoming PDPs and order receipts, and we love
that, right. That's a lever of our business that accrues to us and the more we do that, the more we've got airplanes
going and commitments and orders to our customers. But overall, the trajectory will have to fall quarter in, quarter
out, it's hard to peg because of that accretive offset.

But if you had in your model at some point like a requirement that there has to be some kind of 10-plus billion
dollar reduction in this balance at some point over time, is that just an incorrect understanding of how this all
works?

Well, I'm not going to comment on $10 billion. I do know that there has to be the burndown of the excess, and that
will happen over time. And we do our best to try to isolate that in terms of our projections. On the other hand, the
benefits of order volume is something that we benefit from as well. So it has been flattish over the last several
quarters. It's been taking small chunks down. And we expect it to continue to come down, but I can't call it order of
magnitude of $10 billion drop the way you're suggesting. There's just too many dynamics in there and I'm
reluctant to make those kind of statements.

And then with respect to China in November, I will give you the update. You will probably be as up-to-speed every
week between now and then as I am, because it does require a bit of a thawing and a geopolitical break between
China and the US, so, at any rate, in the meantime we do deliver airplanes occasionally to China based on pure
need, and those are mostly widebodies and mostly cargo.

Yes. Thank you so much. So, it looks like you produced on average 24 737s in the second quarter. How
comfortable are you that you can kind of sustain an average of 31 per month, because I know that you pause
when you have to even though the indicated line rate is 31? And secondly, if you can, should we estimate your
production plus taking 10 or 12 out of inventory to kind of get to what we assume for the production rate in the
second half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                           A
So I'll take the second part of that. I think that reliably month in, month out, we'll aim at 31. Anywhere from 8, 10,
12 is the range on liquidity from inventory, could be in that kind of mix and that gets you to the low-400s for the
total year is the way I would think about it.

I don't think the pieces go much below 8 on the coming from inventory and I probably don't think we'd do better
than 12 in any given month. But we will modulate between that and the production rates as we go into the back
half of the year.

And again, the average of 31 with respect to production is a clear objective of ours and even short of that will be
disappointing. Our real objective though is to make that a stable rate in each of the months. And we're not there
yet. So be careful to extrapolate any one month.

And you've made the point that demand is so strong. What will you have to see to make the decision to raise the
rate from 31 per month?

Dave, on the supply chain, how much will your mitigating actions cost in terms of higher labor costs or
investments for general fabrication or maybe even working capital for buffer stock? And also, as a follow-up on
the engine discussion earlier, what can you do to encourage investment casting suppliers to invest?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                                A
Well, that's – well, I've been trying to encourage them for a very, very long time. Honestly, I think it's going to be,
as is always the case, they are going to increase their margins. My guess is it will be considerable. I don't know all
their contract timings and all their relationships with our engine suppliers, but you know how hard they're going to
be working. And when those margins get to a point where everyone believes it's worth investing a significant
amount of money, that's what they'll do. And I suspect that day will come. And I will encourage the industry in that
way. And they're going to have to believe in our demand forecast which so far I think we've been highly credible
with respect to the long-term demand forecast for airplanes.

So, on all those readiness questions and investments, you're right to ask the question because we've said to
everybody if you're in pursuit of predictability, then you have to invest in all those buffer stocks and you have to
stay ahead of this curve in every way that we possibly can. And I'd say it's marginally more investment intensive,
but not enough to honestly make that big a difference for us going forward, especially when you compare it to our
investment in finished goods inventory, which right now is at a bit of an all-time high.

And I will also – we haven't talked about it, just mention to everybody that while none of us like how we got here, if
you are faced with a bunch of supply constraints as a market over the next couple of years, having over 400
airplanes that are finished at your fingertips, and yeah, they're hard to get out and get ready and back into the
marketplace, is a pretty good buffer in and of itself and allows us to exercise a little extra discipline on the stability
front as we begin to march up that curve over the next 18 months. So anyway, I don't want that to get lost as a
buffer overall.

I'd like to shift the topic to defense for just a minute, your comments about stable global demand. Could you also
comment on international demand in general for defense equipment? And maybe in your answer, also comment
about additional demand for your tanker programs, the KC-46 and MQ-25? And the reason why I'm asking this is,
I believe both these programs had quite aspirations for international sales. So I thought maybe you'd comment on
that as well. Thanks.

Yeah, no, I appreciate the question and we've been bullish on international opportunities. I am more bullish now
than I was when I even began, and again, I was optimistic there. And it is because of the world we see in front of
us. It does take a couple of years to take the threats that are out there, that manifests themselves into real orders
and sort of long commitments. But I suspect that's the way this world will turn here in the next couple of years. We
had some early sure indications from those closest to the conflict. Our Chinook victory here came faster than
maybe we would imagine. Why? Because our customer is right next to the front. So, I am optimistic on the
programs specifically that you called out. They might be on the leading edge of that demand curve. But it's not
going to happen in the next six months and it's not going to – it will take us probably a year to get to where that
demand begins to manifest into real orders.

Thanks for the time. Dave, I'm trying to figure out where all this strong demand is coming from, because the way I
look at it, air show orders were the weakest since 2009 for both you and Airbus, you were better obviously, but
still weakest since 2016. If domestic traffic returns to 2019 in 2023, then the same number of planes should be
needed. Yet, unless retirements really pick up to a level never before we've seen at 5% of the fleet versus the

current 1.3%, there's going to be 2,000 more planes than needed out there. So if you can kind of just reconcile
where all the demand is coming from.

Well, there are an awful lot of irons in the fire. And like you, I try to compare and contrast how many irons in the
fire are now versus where they were certainly in the COVID period, significantly hotter, but even if that prior 2019
world, there's just a lot of irons in the fire and there's already a concern about supply constraints. So you know
what that mix ends up doing.

And then I will just add to that puzzle, you know the sustainability constraints and while you may be skeptical and
maybe I am too about renewal or taking airplanes out of service, I think that day is on us. And I think that's going
to be real in the years ahead. You'd be surprised at how many of the orders, particularly in the mature markets
like Europe, et cetera, where that is the discussion more than any other, which is we need to improve the
sustainability performance of our fleets, otherwise we're going to lose ground.

I will point, if you don't mind, to a tool we introduced at the show called Cascade, which is a measure of emissions
for every airplane every day for everybody. And it's meant to be an open tool for the industry to use, think about
policy changes and all those things that are going to incent the renewal of fleets and the improvement on this
front. That tool is a tool that we'll show you in our November meeting and it's one I hope you'll use, because I do
think that changes that rate of retirement in a pretty big way.

Yeah, because, I mean, you've really got to get to level we've never seen before to get these 2,000 planes out.
And if I even just look at Delta and your recent order with Delta, they're not taking the MAX 10 until 2025. Right
now they've got six [indiscernible] (00:58:41) that are over 25 years old.

Yeah, no, exactly. But those 25-year-olds, I believe the pressure on this will not subside. It will grow and policies
will get written. I think our trick here honestly speaking for the industry for a moment and as you get familiar with
the tool that I'm referring to and think about this, our trick is to make sure that policy with respect to the
environmental and sustainability performance of the aviation fleet does not get so far ahead of the industry that it
stops the music. We've seen that happen in the energy world little bit. I don't want to see that happen in the
aviation world. So that's why this tool is important to us. Incent the retirement of some of the old, less efficient
airplanes and yes, that's good for us and good for the industry, but also educate the policy makers, so they don't
get so far ahead that it begins to constrain the industry's growth.

And how do you think increasing recession concerns affect this? You would think there would be less retirements
then.

Well, so far I'm not sure I can draw the correlation all the way to retirement, but this general recession thing so far
hasn't impacted our aviation industry. Will it at some moment? Maybe. Pricing elasticity has been remarkable as I
look at things, and demand for air travel I think has been prioritized fundamentally to a higher slot in the
consumers' list of priorities. So anyway, I'm not smart enough to draw a perfect line between one and the other,
but I believe that the retirement world is going to change in a pretty big way.
