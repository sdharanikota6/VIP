David L. Calhoun
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.
Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Last time we were together was the
2nd of November where we had a chance for the first time at least in my three-year tenure to talk about guidance
and expectations for the years ahead.

The good news is we had a very solid fourth quarter, a quarter that in my view puts us in good stead to step
forward and meet the guidance that we have delivered to all of you. Not only have we taken big steps to reduce
the risks that of course we'd faced over the last three years, but importantly we're well on our way to restoring the
operational and financial strength that we got used to prior to our MAX moment.

Challenges remain. We have a lot to do, but overall we're feeling pretty good about the way we closed 2022 and
we're well-positioned for 2023 and beyond. Our key metric as everybody knows is free cash flow. Importantly, we
were able to generate more than $3 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter driven by the progress in our
performance and importantly, continued strong demand and this helped us generate positive full year cash flow
for the first time since 2018, a very important turnaround metric for us.

Several key milestones and events that I'd like to highlight. Let's start with the BCA deliveries, which I know
everyone tracks. 2022 total was 480 with 69 deliveries in December. Notably the 737 deliveries we had 387 that
exceeded our target of 375 and it included 31 787s as we unwound inventory and delivered from the production
line following the important return-to-delivery over the course of the summer.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  3

The Boeing Co. (BA)                                                                            Corrected Transcript
Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                       25-Jan-2023


On the order front, and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More
than 800 net orders on the year driven by the 737 MAX and the 787. Highlighted most recently by the very historic
deal with UAL, United Airlines, in December. In 2022 we sold 200-plus net wide-bodies, that's the most since
2018.

More broadly the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well.
Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1000-plus 737 MAXes in total now and since our return
to service the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It's safe and it's the most reliable of the airplane fleets.

Production, we've gone from 0 to 31 a month and we're prioritizing stability which we have not yet achieved but
we're on a steady course to do so, and orders more than 1,500 gross orders to-date. 737 MAX returning to
service in China is another indication of this overall improvement in our business.

This month, of course, we all know that that occurred. We have more airplanes on the Tarmac in China to bring
back into service just as we did here in the US before we began any deliveries of any sort and I'm not going to
guess going forward when deliveries may or may not start. As everyone knows, in our guidance we had derisked
for that possibility.

737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 10, everybody knows we got our extension approved and attached the legislation at the
end of the year. That was a very important moment. I'll remind everyone that that doesn't mean that these were
certified. It simply means that the FAA and Boeing can follow the existing application and do that job and do it the
right way, so we feel very, very good about having derisked that moment as well. I will also want to point out every
argument we made on behalf of that extension related to safety, the premise for our chosen course and the
application that we filed was safety first and it will always be safety first.

Boeing Defense, our SLS launch. This was an enormous emotional upper for our company and for our team
broadly. The Artemis I launch in November which was powered by the SLS rocket was more than a little inspiring,
and I'd like to congratulate the NASA team broadly for the succession of the Starliner mission. It's an incredible
success, incredible and it went beautifully and almost flawlessly every step of the way. So again, a significant
accomplishment for space travel in general. But that rocket again just shows what Boeing is capable of, when we
put our minds to it, we follow our disciplines, we stay patient and ultimately prove to the world that there's more to
do in space.

Boeing Global Services, another terrific story. It is simply following the recovery of our industry in general and
everywhere in the world, so we had a great quarter. Pretty much across-the-board. We continue to grow. We
continue to invest, so that we are prepared to support our customers as they bring their airlines back, back to
where they were before COVID.

So we'll reaffirm our guidance and with this progress, which we feel good about both the financial and the
operational outlook that we shared with you in November, and that includes the cash flow, the delivery ranges that
we set for 2023 as well as for the 2025 and 2026 timeframe.

Our realities are still the same, a difficult, difficult supply chain, and while average deliveries met our objectives,
we continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines simply so that we do not travel work as we run into
supply chain shortfalls, so those stoppages, while they are coming down, are not where they need to be as we
think about stable rates going forward.

I will not in this discussion and/or in Q&A highlight any one supplier within the supply chain. Know that we're
working with all of them. There's a significant amount of transparency in those discussions between them,
between us and everybody is focused on the rate improvements that we have outlined to all of you.

All things considered and reflecting on these last few years, we're feeling pretty good about where we stand
heading into this year. Demand very strong. Portfolio very well-positioned. We have faced plenty of tests in a
number of orders all around the world with some of our toughest customers and we know this portfolio is well-
positioned.

We have a robust pipeline of development programs, including broadly across our Defense business and we're
innovating new capabilities that prepare us for the next generation of products. One of the more significant
achievements was recently announced by NASA and their Sustainable Flight Demonstrator Contract.

This is a set of technologies that's intending to cut fuel emissions by up to 30%. Those are the kind of standards
that in our view are required to ultimately launch a new Commercial Airplane, wrapped in sustainability. We've de-
risked major aspects of the business and our performance is improving. We're embedding Lean across our
operations to drive productivity, ultimately to achieve the kinds of targets that we've set out.

We got work to do, but we're feeling really good about our progress. We're proud of our team, and we're confident
in the future.

With that, I'll turn it over to Brian West.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.
Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next page and cover the fourth quarter
financial results.

Revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $20 billion. That's up 35% year-over-year driven by higher Commercial
volume. Core operating margin was negative 3.3% and the core loss per-share was $1.75. Both the margin and
the loss per share were significantly better than prior year and impacted in the quarter by period expenses and
abnormal costs.

From a free cash flow perspective, our primary financial metric was positive $3.1 billion for the quarter, up
significantly versus the prior year on higher deliveries and strong order activity and up sequentially versus the
prior quarter and a bit better than our original estimate.

I'll take a minute to go through each of the business units. Moving on to the next page with BCA. BCA revenue in
the fourth quarter was $9.2 billion, that's up 94% year-over-year driven by higher 787 and 737 deliveries, partially
offset by 787 customer considerations. On the operating margins, they were negative 6.8% in the quarter, [ph]
signaling (00:11:25) better than a year ago and in the quarter driven by abnormal costs and higher period
expenses, including higher R&D spending.

I'll take a minute to go through a few highlights on the major programs, starting with the 737. We had 110
deliveries in the fourth quarter and 387 for the full year, slightly ahead of our estimate. We ended the year with
250 MAX airplanes in inventory, 30 of which were -7 and -10s and we had 138 for customers in China. We do
expect the monthly deliveries from inventory to slow slightly as fewer airplanes will be available combined with

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                    25-Jan-2023

some impact from the -7 and -10 builds. We still expect most inventoried airplanes will be delivered by the end of
2024.

On the 787, we had 22 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 31 for the full year. We ended the year with 100
airplanes in inventory, most of which will be delivered by the end of 2024. We booked $315 million of abnormal
costs in the quarter taking the total to-date to just $1.7 billion. We're increasing the abnormal accounting estimate
by about $600 million to roughly $2.8 billion in total as we will be under the five per month production rate a bit
longer than expected due to a supplier constraint that is temporarily slowed production.

We still expect to hit five per month this year. Our total year delivery guidance of 70 to 80 is unchanged and
there's no change to 2023 cash flows. 787 orders were strong in the quarter, and we've added 100 airplanes to
the accounting quantity, which increases our GAAP program margin.

On the 777X, the program timeline is holding and efforts are ongoing. Abnormal costs were $112 million in the
quarter and there's no change to the $1.5 billion total estimate. On the customer settlement front, we continue to
make good progress resolving contractual issues on the three big programs. The 737 MAX is near the finish line
with a vast majority of customers settled. Of the original $9.3 billion that is set aside, there's only 3% left.

On the 787, a year ago, we included a significant provision in the program, which has been very stable. There are
far fewer customers in the MAX, and we've already reached agreement with several, all in line with our estimates.

On the 777X, there are even fewer customers and discussions are ongoing. Keep in mind that the revenue and
cash impact of these settlements will be over several years and all contemplated in both the near- and long-term
financial guidance.

Finally, on the orders front for BCA, we booked 376 orders in the quarter and have over 4,500 airplanes in
backlog valued at $330 billion.

Moving on to the next page, I'll cover BDS. BDS revenues in the fourth quarter were $6.2 billion, up 5% year-over-
year. Operating margins were 1.8% and if you include services, defense margins would be 200 basis points
higher to 4%. There are two things impacting BDS margins in the quarter. First, we felt the operational impact of
supply chain constraints and labor instability. Second, we saw adverse timing of certain cost accrual true-ups,
including higher pension costs that flowed through the P&L in the quarter. The big focus for the BDS leadership
team to improve execution stability both in the factory and in the supply base.

Some additional highlights as Dave mentioned we're very proud of Artemis I successful mission to the moon last
November and we delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, including the first P-8 to New Zealand as well as three
satellites including the first two O3b mPOWER units. We received $7 billion in orders during the quarter, including
a contract for two KC-46A tankers from Japan and an award for 12 Chinook helicopters from the Egyptian Air
Force. The BDS backlog is at $54 billion.

Moving on to the next page, Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter primarily driven by our parts and
distribution business. BGS revenue was $4.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year and operating margin was 13.9%.
Commercial volume was very strong partially offset by some softness in the government space. We received $5
billion in orders during the quarter including an F-15 depo support order for the U.S. Air Force and we opened up
the Germany distribution center. The BGS backlog is $19 billion.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                        25-Jan-2023

Moving on to the full-year, the next page. Full-year financial results, revenue came in at $66.6 billion. That's 5%
up year-over-year driven by higher commercial volume offset by lower defense revenue. Core operating margin
was negative 7% and the core loss per share was over $11, both a bit worse reflecting the impact of defense
charges taken earlier in the year. And our free cash flow, we generated $2.3 billion positive free cash flow in the
year up significantly from the prior year driven by higher deliveries and order activity.

Moving on to the next page. I just want to put that $2.3 billion of free cash flow in perspective. As you can see
from the chart on the left, we've made a lot of progress over the last three years. 2020 was a usage of $20 billion
of cash, 2021 improved but was still a usage of $4 billion of cash, and 2022, $2.3 billion positive. As Dave
mentioned, a lot of work that's been done and more work to do. The team is pretty proud to get back to positive
territory. It's been the 737 return to service and the deliveries that are ramping. It's been the 787 that's been
restarted. It's been the commercial market recovery that's been a benefit along the way with a very strong order
book reflecting our customer's confidence in our product lineup, and of course our service business has held up
incredibly well. It was a good exit to 2022 and we expect momentum to continue for 2023.

Moving on to the next page. Cash and debt. On the cash and marketable securities front, we ended the year with
$17.2 billion, up $3 billion versus the third quarter, and we had $12 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which
remain undrawn. On the debt side, we finished the year with $57 billion in debt and as a reminder our investment
grade credit rating continues to be a top priority. Our liquidity position is strong and we're very comfortable
satisfying near-term maturities and the overall plan continues to be deliver airplanes, generate cash, pay down
debt.

Moving on to the next page, 2023. Our financial outlook for 2023 is unchanged from what we shared in
November. Operating cash flow in total will be between $4.5 billion and $6.5 billion. We'll reinvest about $1.5
billion in CapEx for a net free cash flow of $3 billion to $5 billion in 2023. As we start the year overall demand
remains strong. Global passenger traffic increased almost 70% in 2022 and we're at 75% of pre-pandemic levels
globally. And if we take out China, that number goes to over 90%. So demand is pretty robust and reflective of our
order book. Our priority continues to be execution stability and while we still see some disruptions in the factory
and into the supply chain, we're hard at work with our partners to address these issues and ultimately focused on
meeting our customer commitments.

On the segment operating cash flow, same numbers as November. BDS, we expect to be a usage of between
$0.5 billion and $1 billion of cash. BGS will generate between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. And BCA will generate
between $2.5 billion and $3.5 billion. On the commercial delivery front, 737 deliveries are unchanged, and
between 400 and 450 airplanes. 787 deliveries are unchanged, between 70 and 80 airplanes. And we've added a
couple items on the expense front. We expect R&D for 2023 to come in at about $3.2 billion versus $2.9 billion in
2022. The vast majority of this increase will be in BCA.

We also have unallocated, eliminations and other, which will be relatively in line with 2022 at $1.6 billion. One
important thing to note is on the quarterly phasing, it will look very similar to last year as both deliveries and the
financials will improve throughout the course of the year. On the first quarter specifically, EPS will be an
improvement over 4Q 2022 but remain in a loss position, and cash will still be a usage in the first quarter although
an improvement from the first quarter of 2022. Overall, we're squarely focused on free cash flow and so far so
good as we enter 2023.

Moving on to the last page, 2025 to 2026 long-term guidance. Same page we showed you in November, $10
billion of free cash flow is still our objective. And it is important to note that margins and EPS are important, but
they will be uneven over the next two years, as we unwind the BCA inventory, we put the BCA abnormal cost

behind us, and we get the BDS margins back on track to its normal trajectory. We're still confident that this plan is
underpinned by things we largely control.

One, productivity; two, the commercial rate ramp; three, services growth; and four, the transition of key defense
programs from development to production. Overall, we're as confident today as we were back in November, and
we feel good about the way 2023 is starting.

With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for any final comments.

Yeah. I think, Brian, the numbers speak for themselves. We couldn't be more pleased with the way the year
closed with very few surprises. We're heading into the year. We know the supply chain is going to be tough and
constrained but we also believe that we control that environment and it's our job to get ahead of it. So thank you.

Hey. So congrats on the progress in deliveries in the fourth quarter and the free cash flow generation and you
reiterated obviously the long-term free cash flow target to $10 billion in mid-decade and $3 billion to $5 billion in
2023. So Brian I guess on 2023, can you just maybe talk around confidence levels around that expected free
cash flow target specifically at BCA and BDS, like kind of what are the key risks to call out. I assume it's supply
chain around the guidance ranges.

And then just Dave unrelated question, but can you comment broadly on the pick up in MAX flights in China?
Our checks showed 220 revenue flights that are scheduled in February and there's already 60 flights have
occurred this month, so clearly there's MAX activity that's picking up in China. Thanks.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call                                                                                                                                                                                                      25-Jan-2023

Yeah, Peter, why don't I start with China. Your numbers are within the range of my numbers. That is what's going
on. I think as everybody knows, the opening up of China is going to be a major event in aviation, and the aviation
industry was already stressed in terms of demand broadly in the world. So this is a serious bump for everybody
but most importantly, within China, they need the MAX to fly, to satisfy those demands. So we were going to do
there what we do here in the US and focus on the airplanes they have on the tarmac today, which is close to 100
airplanes. The readiness of each and every one of them, and ultimately they're getting into full revenue service.

So for six months I think that's the course for all of us to stay focused on. And then we're going to take up the
question of deliveries, and is there a moment in time where that begins to come back. I don't want to predict that
date, Peter, but the odds go up every day our MAX gets back into service. And the airplanes that we have on our
tarmacs, hopefully, we get ready and deliver to our customers. So I think there's a reason to be optimistic. We will
not change guidance and/or predict those outcomes until they actually occur.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                   A
And Peter, on the cash flow, the $3 billion to $5 billion, again we feel very confident with that range. The key
underpinnings will be the delivery that we talked about. The 737, at the low-end assumes that we don't get much
better through the course of 2023 than we did this past year, which is low-30s for the whole year.

At the high-end, it actually says we do low-30s first half and then low-40s second half. So I think that all of that is
within the mix, as you recall, we had a big December. One caution is that December was kind of over 50 on the
MAXs, but October was not quite that high, and that's an indication that we're still not stable, still bumpy, but we
still feel good about the overall trajectory in terms of being able to hit the 400 to 450 airplanes.

On the 787 similarly, we feel good about where we landed and then where we're headed to hit the 70 to 80
airplanes, which underpins pretty much most of the cash flow for BCA those two product lines. And then BDS, no
change to what we thought, things plan out pretty much as we expected.

move up from there given that you're facilitized and staffed for 38 airplanes. And if you look at the 2025 or 2026
timeframe, when you are guiding to 50 airplanes a month, and you were once at 57 airplanes a month, so that
would not be new territory, so what I'm trying to get at it is when you look at these two-years, clearly, there are
supplier issues in 2023, but is it feasible that you could see that production rate go higher. And if so, what would
you want to see? And I'd look at 2023 and 2025 differently since 2025 I'm assuming we would be out from under
a lot of these supplier issues.

Yeah, Doug. Again, now I don't want to conjecture too much, but the two essential things to achieve that kind of
objective. Number one, are we facilitized at that kind of rate, and the answer is, as we progress through this year,
will be, yes. Number two, and by far the more challenging is, are we going to be stable month-to-month, quarter-
to-quarter, predictable where the supply chain and the buffers that we put in place with respect to that supply
chain are adequate.

That's a harder, tougher putt. I think it's going to take us all year to ultimately demonstrate that stability can and
will be achieved. And if I get to that, and I hope I do, we do, then I'll take on that conjecture, but for right now, we
are just squarely focused on that question of stability. As Brian said, our fourth quarter was good. We finished
well. We didn't have a lot of surprises in December. But if you look at the month-to-month in the quarter, you can't
be happy with that. We had just a few too many stoppages along the way. As you know our philosophy is we're
not going to travel anything anymore, we're not going to compound issues that occur, and we're going to maintain
that philosophy. So watch the month-to-month, that's going to tell you a lot about our willingness to consider the
rates you're talking about.

And is that true when you look out to the 2025 to 2026 timeframe, obviously there's a long way to go before we
get there. How do you think about just flexibility given there may be a number of scenarios that could come out
here in terms of production levels.

Well, as I said, will we be facilitized to handle that kind of volume at that stage? Yes. We'll stay well ahead of that.
And you'll see things that occur over this year that will demonstrate that. So that's the part of it, I'm not so worried
about. Again, it's stability questions and then there will be a factor that will have to apply with respect to China.
We're going to have to believe we're back, and we're back for good.

I wanted to ask about supply chain. Can you – I heard you, Dave, that you're not going to mention any specific
supplier and I hear that and respect that, but if you could provide any more detail on what's happening on the 787.
Is there a new quality control escape or is it just pure timing delays, visibility into that getting better? Any
incremental detail there would be really helpful. And then what's the latest from the engine OEMs? Sounded a
little better yesterday but what are you guys hearing?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                                A
Well, let me start with the latter, the engine discussion. Again, what I'm really happy with is the transparency with
which we are planning for rates with our engine suppliers, and you know who they are, and predominantly one,
and I'm feeling good about that. And we have plans to do it, I don't think any of us are yet at that high confidence
moment on that, but we will. And that progression will occur over the course of the year when we are at high
confidence then we're going to get to the kind of rates that are built into our guidance.

We've got a low-end and a higher end and we'll find out where we're going to fit on that, depending on it. But the
transparency is amazing. No one is out-guessing each other. And because this market has been so strong, no
one is second guessing the rates. Everybody knows these rates if we get to them, we'll achieve them and then we
can continue to move forward. So there's a lot of good, but until we see it month-to-month and until we get to that
high confidence moment, we're going to hold our production rate steady.

And, Brian, you're up-to-date on the 787 discussion.

Yeah. So on the 787, so the fourth quarter was our first real full quarter in a while of being able to deliver
airplanes both from the factory which is still is at a low-rate and also from inventory, and it feels pretty good and
as we go into 2023, remember the scope of work is pretty clear what we have to do in terms of reworking the
inventoried airplanes. But remember, our suppliers have a part of that responsibility in their scope, so bringing
the suppliers, the big suppliers along to make sure that they are conforming and they've got all the protocols in
place to get that done on their end is something that we're working our way through.

It's going to take us a little bit longer than originally expected which is why we are going to shift out going to 5
airplanes per month a bit later in the year, but we still see 70 to 80 airplanes in the cards and so far so good.
What you'll likely see is some good liquidation of the inventories that go through the year. And then obviously,
ramp up the factory as we get deeper into the year, but net-net, the 70 to 80 airplanes we still feel good about.

Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify a couple things. One, Brian, I think you mentioned $600 million
higher abnormal costs on the 787. Is that cash? Is that absorbed now in 2023 unchanged free cash flow
guidance. And then also, for defense, if you could just touch on your margin profitability expectation and rough
magnitude for 2023? Thanks.

Sure. So in terms of the first question, the 787 abnormal. There is no cash impact. Part of that is just because part
of that is just fixed cost absorption, but there's no change in the cash outlook. It's not significant in that regard so
we're holding.

On the defense margins, so in the quarter as I mentioned, we had some bumped around from the supply chain
constraint and some of the labor knock us in the fourth quarter as well as some of the timing of accruals that I
mentioned. As we move our way into 2023, we clearly expect those margins to get better. It's not going to be all
the way back to what normal might look like but it's going to be improve sequentially, and we feel pretty good
about the lineup in terms of the product portfolio and as we remind you is that the products are performing
incredibly well with the customers. So we feel good about the underlying base with BDS. Margins will get better,
and we're positioned for that as we head into the year.

the demand for air travel has been pretty strong. Can you talk about what your customers are saying about
potential new aircraft orders? Should we anticipate more airlines making landmark orders like United and could
we see BCA at a positive book-to-bill for the year?

Yeah, again, I always hesitate to forecast specific orders. I will say that we're involved in more big orders now
than we've been in a long time. I think last year was a big indicator for folks that big orders are out there. I think
the United one is in fact indicative, but Delta earlier. There's just, there are some big interests in aviation. I'd say
the majority now outside the US as opposed to inside the US and we're considering some really big things, and
we're in the midst of all of those.

So, yeah, I have a – I'm pretty optimistic. I'm not going to forecast numbers because that's never healthy, but I do
think over the next couple of quarters, you'll see some big decisions made to both manufacturers and you'll see
some new entrants into the aviation world that aim to make a real difference, and again, largely in the global
markets.

Thanks, Dave, and if I could do a follow-up. With that environment that you describe, it sounds pretty robust. Can
you describe the pricing environment for these orders and how they compared to pre-COVID levels?

Yeah, well when you're in the midst of any one deal it feels ruthless, but if you really do balance it out and I guess,
I'd credit both manufacturers. It's been pretty disciplined through this whole COVID moment and so you see very
few reaches and sort of crazy things that are out of the norm and now, we're in sort of that supply chain constraint
world where people simply want to get positions so that they know they have airplanes when the time comes.

Recessions don't seem to get in the way because remember, we're competing for deliveries out four and five
years from now, so they're not really computing recession into that. So anyway, again, I feel good and I also, I'm
going to guess that – because it's always a guess, that pricing will stay disciplined.

Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning. And really, I guess just a little bit of a quick clarification this morning
rather than a question. Just making sure to understand the difference between production and deliveries this year
on 737. When you say the high-end of the guidance is assuming low-30s and moving to high-40s, you're talking
deliveries there, and then with regard to production, when you say that you are kind of hoping to get to a place
where you see some stability this year, that's with regard to production in the factory and so that would make it
seem unlikely that the production rate is going higher than 31 this year. Is that a fair way to think about things,
regardless of where the deliveries shake out?

You're right on characterizing the delivery framework, and I would say that as we move through the course of the
year, and we'll have fewer inventoried airplanes, that will put a little bit more opportunity on units coming out of the
factory so production rate at the right moment could get higher. We'll wait and see. We're just going to stick to the
range for now.

Right, right. And as far as that stability that you're looking for, how much at this point would you say needs to
come from improvement in the supply chain versus any improvement that's necessary in the internal productivity?

Yeah, look, I don't want to suggest that we don't have our own opportunities internally. We do mostly driving cycle
out and creating buffers in the right positions, et cetera. All things that you would attach to a company that really
practices Lean, so we will make improvements there, but the lion's share of the rate discussions is going to be
built around the supply chain and the capacity, literally the capacity and capability of that supply chain to meet the
new rates, and as I said, very transparent discussions.

It's almost entirely built around labor availability, trained labor availability as we move through the course of the
year. Hiring is not a constraint anymore. People are able to hire the people they need. It's all about the training
and ultimately getting them ready to do the sophisticated work that we demand.

Yes. Thank you very much. Could you update us on your efforts to certify the MAX 7 and 10 as well as the 777X
and as part of that, the agreement to allow you to push out the certification dates of the 7 and the 10. I think you
agreed to back fit some software changes on the existing MAX fleet. Could you tell us how much that's likely to
cost, when did you take the accounting impact? Thank you.

I'll take the last part of that to get that off the table, Cai. Thanks. The provision to retrofit the fleet was taken in the
fourth quarter. That's behind us. It was small.

There's a reason why it's small but I just, I hope everybody knows and understands how important it was to get
those extensions in place and the legislation. The argument was purely a safety argument. Fortunately, we got a
lot of support on both sides of the aisle, and we got it done, so this gives us all the flexibility we need to get these
airplanes certified under the existing applications and we feel good about that. We think first delivery for the 7 will
be this year and probably for the 10 the next year.

So we like where that stands. Everybody is calm. The FAA, nobody ever put pencils down, so we're just going to
progress and like always, we're not going to tell you exact dates as to when we expect those certifications. So all
feels good and then yes, the legislation that was approved included some improvements that we put into our
cockpit on the -10 that everybody agrees are useful and helpful to pilots, and those largely software adjustments
will be incorporated into the entire MAX fleet over several years.

As Brian said, it's not a large number but we provided for it and we're confident we can meet those objectives,
provided the Cert, and those improvements are accomplished here in the next year or two.

I'm sorry. Everything is on course for the 777X, and I think the only issue that has created some concern over the
last couple of years has been our agreement with the EASA on some of design principles that we think we're
making terrific progress with the EASA and I think we will have a coordinated regulator, regulatory approach
to the Cert, and so we're staying on our targets.

Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. Could you touch on the large pickup in 787 deferred, the balance
in the quarter, what that means going forward for the cash outlook on the 787 and also, Brian, if you could just
touch on the big pickup that we saw in the BCA unit loss. Is that just related to the higher 787 deliveries in the
quarter? Thanks.

Yeah, on the deferred production balance, that's basically the 787 cost base extension that I mentioned has an
impact on program margins and that's amplified by all the finished goods inventory, it's sitting there on the 100
airplanes so that's driving the increase.

And your last question, basically, it's impacted by customer mix and the impact of customer concessions and
considerations.

Yes, but only partially and as of now, when you see the sort of the results of that effort, you can assume that we'll
be on pause with respect to that until we get, until we understand completely where China wants to go. So the
answer is yes and you'll see progress, but you'll also see a pause so that we can discern what China wants to do,
and hopefully that's good news.

Hey. Good morning, everybody. Brian, just a quick clarification question and then one over on the services
business. On the clarification, you mentioned that margins at BDS tick up in 2023, but don't get back to the long-
term margin rates that you expected on a normalized basis. Just curious what the milestones are going to be for
us to be watching out for on getting back to those normalized rates. And then on the services business maybe just
a little bit more color on expectations for 2023 with regard to your expectations on growth rate and margins.
Thanks.

Yeah, sure. On the BDS, so as we mentioned, long-term high-single digits is what we've talked about. But in the
near-term, the same kind of supply chain constraints and labor availability that we've talked about in the BCA
world impact the BDS world as well. So when the current environment is less constrained and stabilizes, that'll be
a benefit. We expect it to happen partly in 2023, but the key, I think, to watch is just the stability of the supply
chain is going to be a big, big deal that we're keeping our eye on and that's going to be important as margins will
tend to accelerate. The time and the pace remains to be seen, but it will get better in 2023.

On the services side, so we had a big year for the services business. It's going to have to – and part of that was
based in the commercial recovery and we enjoyed the benefit of that in 2022, but BGS in terms of their revenue,
they finished the quarter at a pretty got spot, pretty clean basis and if you just kind of think about that as how you
would extrapolate into 2023 by quarter it gives you a pretty good view of where we see that growth coming for, so
it will grow, margin will be just fine, right within that mid-teen levels that we've enjoyed, so we feel pretty good
about the prospects for the service business, very stable, continue to grow, no surprises.

Just circling back thinking about product development and so on and so forth, like you mentioned at the Investor
Day that Boeing wouldn't be going forward with a middle of the market product probably until sometime in the
2030s. How should we think about that in light of the recent win with NASA on the truss-braced Transonic wing
program and what that means? Could that be some early technology on a new platform or what are you looking
for to happen in the technology world to feel confident about doing something new?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.                                                                                                                                                                                A
Yeah, so, Ron, I'm going to highlight three things that I think are going to contribute to a truly differentiated new
product. One of them is the truss wing so I'll refer to that now. As you know that that is technology it's been
worked on for the better part of a decade, alongside of NASA, and the program that we've embarked on here is
how do you commercialize it? How do we put it through the right set of tests, et cetera, so that it in fact can be
incorporated into new airplanes, so there's real intent there to be able to do it. I'm not sure it is going to be as
good and/or applicable for middle of the market and/or wide-body but it will definitely have a role to play some
day in the narrow-body world, so that's number one.

Number two, you've heard us talk about the digital thread being able to create the digital model not just for the
airplane but for the factory and for the servicing, but we are really cutting our teeth on a couple of defense
programs that frankly we're learning a lot every day, all day, so that whatever we do on that next commercial
airplane will incorporate the digital thread and it will be way more mature than what it's been so far in our discrete
defense programs, so anyway, I feel very good about that. And then the last major element has been the one that
usually carried the day but in this case I think will simply contribute to a better day and that's propulsion
technologies.

Bigger bypass ratios and you probably know a truss wing setup will create that opportunity to a far greater extent
than today's wing, simply because of the distance from the ground, so there are lots of reasons why I think these
technologies can and will be proven and ultimately adapted and when you're considering a 50-year kind of
program for any new airplane you have to think about this and in our view, the objective has to be somewhere
between 25% and 30% better than it is today, and that's what we're focused on and I think we have the time to do
it and the technologies to play out.

Got it. And if I can just a quick detailed follow-on. What are you thinking about head count productions as we go –
or head count projections as we go into 2023? I mean how has it been in the labor market and kind of across the
supply chain what you hear is everybody needs more people and how has it been for Boeing and what are you
doing to try to cross that bridge?

Yeah, hey, Ron, I want to be clear. We have had no trouble hiring people. None. We're sort of at or a little above
of where we were in the days you guys all remember, because we've got so many of these rework apparatuses
going on and there are a lot of people required to do it, so our job is to actually just take what we have,
incorporate all of the learning from the folks who are doing the rework. That will displace whatever retirements
and/or demographic issues that we have over the next couple of years.

We have a pretty good set up on labor and a pretty good mechanism ironically with these return to service aircraft
and the join verification, a pretty good mechanism to train mechanics, train our people to do the job, and on the
engineering front, man, we've had a real good run, hiring is over 10,000. Our job is to make sure that we just train
them right, get them involved early, and get on [ph] to live (00:51:15) so we are not facing a big demand.

Our supply chain probably still is work in the hiring a bit but it's nowhere near as important as their – the training of

So you're not going to be surprised I'd like to ask you about defense. I wanted to know first could you broadly
discuss your defense portfolio, the opportunity set and what we should be focusing on? Just by example I noticed
at AIAA you were discussing a C-17, C-130 recap. Second to that could you also discuss the F-15EX program in
terms of expectations for deliveries, production rates and also if margins on the program might be comparable to
what we saw when you were selling older models under FMS. Thanks.

Yeah, so let me take this one. Let me address it at the portfolio level. In light of the difficulties we've had with the
fixed price development contracts, which I consider more of a contracting exposure as opposed to a portfolio
exposure, I feel really good about the portfolio broadly and there are reasons why I feel that way.

We're fully invested as you know autonomy. I believe autonomy and teaming are going to be one of the real
drivers with respect to airplane development, Air Force, Navy requirements going forward, and we're already
invested and we're making real progress with both of those members of the fighting forces, and I'm sure you know
the programs that we talked about and there are others we can't talk about which were as excited if not more
excited about.

So the long portfolio and the development that we've sustained over all these years I feel really good about. We
have the T-7 trainer. It's way more important than just the market for trainers itself. Ultimately we think it can be
used as a derivative to do other things for the Air Force and I'm sure you know what that's about, but maybe even
more importantly, it's an absolute poster child for our digital thread and it's teaching our customer how to think

about the use of the digital thread and it's teaching us how to perfect all the production technologies that we need
to take full advantage of the digital thread.

So if I look at just our sort of our wing fleets, I feel very good about where we are and as you point out, the F-15,
the new derivatives, boy, they are really important to our customers. We feel great about the future. It feels like a
new platform frankly from my perspective. I'm not going to handout production rates at this stage, but we're
feeling pretty good about the international demand as well as our US demand and in light of their only other
choices this gets frankly more valuable over time, until the really new classified work ultimately is completed and
brought to the market.

Anyway, I feel quite good about the portfolio. It's development, where we stand in it, and I'm sorry some of the
contracting methods that we used in the early going here but anyway we are where we are and I can't get off the
page without talking about the Tanker, which we all still believe very, very strongly in, again, difficult contracting
moment for us. On the other hand, it's utility to the Air Force has been fantastic. The vision system, our
commitment to it and then technologies beyond that allow for even autonomous refueling these are things we're
fully invested in and we believe in the growth of the industry and the need with our customer. So anyway, there
are other things and you'd probably know a lot of that but there's a reason to feel good frankly on the development
front with respect to Boeing's defense business.

Good morning, guys, and thank you. I know it's been asked a thousand different ways but I don't know if I know
the answer yet, so maybe, Dave, can you give us an idea of how – where are you on the MAX and 787 from a
cash per aircraft perspective or how far that is below prior peak and is there a cadence of that profitability free
cash flow as we think about production rates increasing, supply chain impacts, and just pricing as you get aircraft
out of inventory.

Let me take a shot at the – I'll talk cash margins and let's start with the 787. So, near-term, they're pressured but
positive and we got to work through all the things that we've been describing, and in long-term, they're going to be

higher than they were back in 2018 driven by productivity, pricing in the dash-10 model so the 787 feels like it's
on the verge of doing some real special stuff over the long-term.

On the 737, near-term pressure because all the supply chain things we talked about, some customer mix things
that we're going to battle through, and possibly some impact to remarketing and then long-term, it's going to be
more or less in line with what it was before and the benefit being the productivity and the rate ramp, so the that's
kind of how we think about those two programs over time from a cash perspective.

You really – Sheila, you really have to get through calendar year 2024 and then a lot of the clouds, a lot of the
things that we've been wrestling with, the things that impact our margins and the lumpiness along the way, that all
begins to clear as we get to the tail end of 2024 and then as we think about 2025 and on, I think that clarity will be
apparent to everybody.
