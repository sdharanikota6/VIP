sound quality question please press star one touchtone telephone first question comes devin mcdermott morgan stanley devin mcdermott morgan stanley good morning thanks taking question jay wanted congratulate retirement plans take advantage call first one tco great see project progress wpmp portion project largely complete wondering could talk little bit remaining milestones second phase fgp progress toward first half startup jay johnson thank devin retirement wishes question tco weve steadily making progress strong period first half year unrest january course team responded well even covid omicron impacts expect finish construction everything year largely commissioning phase largely putting together pressure testing filling fluids cleaning systems preparing eventual startup wpmp expect second half next year around enabling us boost pressure field facilities dont expect see material change production point time enables us move phase startup fgp start see incremental production coming plant big milestones weve already accomplished production wells already produced completed actually producing plant helps us transition highpressure lowpressure phase weve got injection wells already completed begin fgp startup field facilities well underway terms new gathering system metering stations converted highpressure lowpressure theyll done one time maintain production period wont see lot outward signs progress commissioning number subsystems completed thats really moving complete overall whats going important rundown curves bring system completion devin mcdermott great thank helpful great progress sticking tco part portfolio theres lot headlines around cpc pipeline recent weeks months wondering could give us status update things stand also extent disruptions flows pipe talk little bit impacts operations base existing production area jay johnson cpc pipeline continues important export route us handles majority kazakh crude thats exported western markets represents important supply world million barrels oil day coming oil put line kazakhstan carries certificate origin kazakhstan weve done lot work washington dc brussels make sure people understand importance pipeline world supply weve seen reliability capacity able maintain levels need interruptions weve seen managed weve gotten look forward continue work kazakh government international consortium owns operates cpc pipeline maintain important export route crude alternate export routes developed cpc remains primary important route us devin mcdermott got clarify moment operationally normal nameplate flow rates pipe jay johnson yeah full capacity tco cpc pipeline actually work quite well us take pipeline ongoing maintenance pipelines time time coordinate producers theyre often coordinated turnarounds producing facilities undergoing recent downtime cpc dealing results survey work around terminal coordinated ncoc turnaround activities didnt impact tcos production devin mcdermott great thanks much jay johnson thanks devin operator neil mehta well take next question neil mehta goldman sachs goldman sachs hey good morning team jay thank insights years wish well retirement sir jay johnson thank neil mehta first question capital returns guys raised top end buyback guidance talk math went think optimal return capital formation whether buybacks dividend growth pierre breber thanks neil pierre ill take ill go financial priorities theyve consistent decades literally first financial priority grow dividend weve done consecutive years increased earlier year since right covid doubled since second invest grow traditional new energy saw total investments first half year versus year ago third maintain strong balance sheet fifth consecutive quarter paid debt net debt ratio thats well midcycle guidance cash excess first three priorities buy back shares intend ratably cycle repurchased shares last years bought back almost billion time average price around share close weighted average price whole time said increased top range guidance billion year represents shares quarter billion annual rate based current outlook tested number scenarios rate consistent chevron investor day upside leverage case brent flat nominal price five years weve said previous buyback rates intend maintain buybacks annual rate number years across commodity cycle reminder net debt well midcycle guidance range well continue buybacks even commodity cycle turns well lever back balance sheet closer guidance range neil mehta pierre followup permian talk youre thinking growth profile relative guided beginning year upward drift commodity prices change way youre thinking prosecuting asset jay johnson neil ill start pierre finish hes got thoughts approach permian know many years disciplined focused generating returns efficiency allow us profitable regardless prices responding shortterm price increasing activity levels since turndown covid seen investment go year billion higher last year also see number wells putting production going expect pops year looking increase permian production weve increased two additional rigs july running fleet rigs across permian current time expect maintain second half ill remind also one rigs today drills equivalent two rigs could using rig counts careful much efficient rigs frac crew today also completing roughly double work back much efficient four years ago expect see investment continue grow weve given guidance increasing investment rate billion year would expect see relatively flat maintain efficient operation across permian also nonoperated activity currently nine net rigs running nonop side also contributes significantly production profile guidance remains unchanged wed expect see million barrels day production ultimately plateau continue gain insights knowledge look efficiencies look portfolio world demand change go forward thats guidance see today well continue update move forward time pierre breber add also among carbonefficient barrels portfolio jay said demonstration delivering objectives higher returns lower carbon thanks neil operator jeanine wai thank well take next question jeanine wai barclays barclays hi good morning everyone thanks taking questions jay johnson morning jeanine wai jay wed also like wish well thank time years well stick two upstream questions get two last leave first one lng week announcement chevron along couple partners guys reached fid development thatll help boost angola lng plant volumes talk youre viewing expansion opportunities angola also hit equatorial guinea also kind equity position feeds lng plant preference involvement evolves lng plants equity ownership also know cheniere agreement announced recently marketing front wondering youre seeing role new opportunities jay johnson pretty good jeanine think got three questions im going try move right jeanine wai oh one jay johnson know teasing im allowed im upstream guy lng angola youre right took fid new gas consortium two primary sources gas angola lng traditionally built associated gas thats produced along oil resources angola thats main source gas angola lng point continue develop new oil resources year extension secured really good terms oil gas encourages investment country theres lot oil still block continues unabated actually investment move forward nonassociated gas words drilling developing reservoirs gas new investment mode consortium mentioned thats designed supplemental gas keep angola lng facilities full ongoing effort keep plant running really economic builds existing infrastructure thats already built investments already made importantly supplying needed lng european market also gives us exposure atlantic basin thats good project us pleased take fid eg exposure atlantic basin project continue produce theres much say thats also profitable area us came us noble acquisition kind one hidden jewels talk eastern med talk dj basin particular eg supplying good return us gas lng facilities terms focus ownership versus commercial really pretty agnostic looking returns scale build business looking multiple points supply maintain active profitable portfolio commercial deals use capital really able leverage facilities thats always nice way us go im pleased get exposure gulf coast european potentially asian markets gives us access lot produced gas north america access markets rather us makes sense well also make investments places facilities run joint venture nonoperated facilities really look gives us best opportunity generate returns looking jeanine wai right thank wont sneak unrelated followup since fulsome response thank jay johnson okay thanks jeanine pierre breber thanks jeanine operator doug leggate well take next question doug leggate bank america bank america thank years one place jay thats pretty impressive congratulations sir jay johnson thank doug leggate wonder could take maybe two questions actually maybe pierre might prefer second one want go permian first half production operated half nonoperated parse inflationary pressures operated nonoperated youre seeing currently jay johnson difficult really definitively say though think competitive advantage permian couple things working favor maintain global supply chain able tap suppliers equipment materials goods services much broader range maybe competitors also multiyear contracts mechanisms commercially allow us mitigate inflationary pressures see today course focus driving improved productivity improved efficiency really helped us continue counter inflationary pressures think area distinct advantage weve building infrastructure permian proof point last wells last five years produce wells build central tank batteries look forward next wells need build additional four central tank batteries others invest high inflationary period largely using infrastructure built past five years small incremental surface facilities required think thats going hard others match doug leggate thats clear answer thank pierre dont know quite ask question im going try get part part b perhaps ill respectful mike interviewed recently talking tightness global oil market think said something like dont want put words mouth weakness oil prices going fleeting underinvestment guys obviously stepped spending covid levels youre still well precovid levels lets say balance sheet depth opportunities obviously youre funding think continued commitment current capex level see chevron reengage organic growth point pierre breber think theres change guidance capital track likely end billion budget weve ramping course first half year think youll see us higher second half year likely end year billion budget guidance shared march chevron investor day billion organic capital investments budget year around billion billion room increase activity investment within guidance jay described major capital project kazakhstan winding itll decrease spending billion opens another billion increase investment activity next year expect work right well share details december finalized approved board well increase within guidance guidance enables us sustain grow upstream business weve talked compounded annual growth rate add refinery capacity bought refinery pasadena texas kept us refineries covid making investments pasadena refinery recently fided course activities grow new energies within guidance recognize jay one things deserves lot credit upstream business much capital efficient ever mindset deliver business results less capital theres free cash flow shareholders operator john royall thank well take next question john royall jp morgan jp morgan hey good morning thanks taking question talk growth gulf mexico upstream youre leaning number brownfield projects speak broadly view gom within portfolio returns look boltons relative options globally upstream service inflation picture look like part system relative say permian jay johnson thank john ill start let pierre add really quite pleased portfolio maintain gulf mexico good area exploration us lowest carbon intensity world kg coe per boe produced world scale even company scale already top quartile right bottom end range great area develop future production carbon efficiency look queue projects weve got anchor project expecting first oil weve got whale coming expect weve expanding existing facilities starting waterflood st malo part jackst malo complex weve installed multiphase pumps commissioning thats going important milestone technologically ability step took fid ballymore ballymore interesting one nice sized discovery could really capitalize get much higher return taking three wells back host facility blind faith able develop pleased able see higher return coming blind faith also helps existing production blind faith continue work forward think going see growth gulf mexico production going important continue able lease acquire additional acreage basin along others theres still think room continual exploration tieback great chain infrastructure able produce lower carbon fuel pierre breber add rigs largely contracted rates lower clearly offshore rigs increased largely contracted prior rates thanks john john royall thank yes downstream question particularly california kind goforward views product balance quite tight parts country seeing capacity come due rd conversions looking maybe mediumterm view refining california specifically pierre breber downstream side strong quarter good execution reliable operations high refinery utilization im talking generally us west coast gulf coast good cost control able capture margins marketplace slight benefit second quarter richmond turnaround deferred little bit less impact guided first quarter call timing effects really werent driver timing absence timing effects saw terms markets theyre volatile right weve seen margins come second quarter saw demand response gasoline probably around midsingle digits across us little bit higher west coast little bit lower gulf coast didnt really see much diesel side jet really tied recovery travel well see market takes us whether west coast gulf coast focused safe reliable operations continuing good cost control delivering products customers demanding thanks john operator jason gabelman thank well take next question jason gabelman cowen cowen hey thanks taking questions one upstream portfolio one financials upstream talk gas opportunities available queue specifically im thinking eastern med know youre delineating acreage seems like theres lot gas available exploit also believe haynesville position im sure thats money youre looking ill ask followup thanks jay johnson thank lot gas opportunities weve got lot infrastructure build opportunities really important gives us advantage return standpoint eastern med ill add one lowest carbon intensity areas scope scope kg coe per boe produced course supplied lot gas israeli market opportunity continues grow coal displaced also take gas jordan conversion electric power taking egypt supply domestic needs egypt also potentially access ullage exists lng facilities already existing egypt considering floating lng well know benign conditions med ocean conditions mediterranean lend floating lng represents viable option us developing additional gas capacity leviathan tamar well within scope projects would allow us access additional marketing opportunities lng flexibility provides continue upside potential additional fields eg weve got access pointed united states ramping drilling activity haynesville expect see rigs starting later year theyll working area profitable even low prices profitable focus going discipline continuing drive efficiencies really excited get haynesville underway add portfolio part country thank jason gabelman great thanks followup share count believe went quarter despite buyback gone since buyback started think back shares issued noble flattish discuss exactly whats going expectations share count moving forward higher buyback also higher share price thanks pierre breber yes share count going go see earnings press release weighted average course quarter necessarily end quarter youll see q share count end second quarter fact lower first quarter youd expect bought back billion shares issued billion worth shares stock option exercises first quarter large issuance employees retirees exercising stock options started year lower share count issued employee retiree stock options therefore started second quarter higher rate worked way math work going look end quarter end quarter see terms earnings per share average quarter kind quirk second quarter average higher first quarter nature pattern quarter share counts going thanks jason operator manav gupta thank well take next question manav gupta credit suisse credit suisse thank guys first question wanted take expertise jay heavy turnaround quarter even things turning around highmargin barrels whether tco angola wheatstone help us understand terms opportunity cost volume somewhere lowermargin business versus highermargin business youre saying upstream results good could even better higher margin barrels actually turnaround jay johnson appreciate question manav one things thats really important us operate safely reliably look schedule turnarounds theyre predominantly ensure asset integrity ongoing reliable performance schedule dont like shift market conditions tend want execute time whats important execute within timeframes expected production accordance planning wheatstone angola lng done really really well proud teams went turnaround means australia five trains first round turnarounds thats important milestone important accomplishment work may seem like giving opportunities nearterm allows us continue drive higher higher reliability means overall production higher costs lower safety higher thats really think manav gupta thank quick policy question month half ago things got little heated oil companies white house understand actual executive meetings happen guys others secretary energy pretty cordial guys looking solutions help us understand happened meeting energy secretary go pierre breber manav wont comment specifics engagements think youre right constructive productive ill point us oil gas production first half year versus last year us refined product sales versus last year administration wants energy supplies increase investment globally first half year look us double include reg chevron growing energy supply increasing investment engaging constructively congress administration thanks manav operator biraj borkhataria thank well take next question biraj borkhataria rbc rbc capital markets hi thanks taking questions one australia mean theres gas shortages many geographies europe particular theres talk noise around australia wanted understand whether expect export issues gorgon wheatstone discussions government around proportion gas going domestic market versus whats exported anything like color would great thank jay johnson thanks biraj shortages youve heard australia east coast pipelines connecting west coast east coast actually way could supply gas east coast australia form lng longterm contract customers throughout asia also sell spot markets facilities interest north west shelf well course wheatstone gorgon western australian market well supplied part agreements supply really issues dont see impact export capabilities australia biraj borkhataria okay understood followup topic couple years ago think conversation pierre around potential increasing nameplate capacity gorgon wheatstone time go various debottlenecking exercises able provide update whether thats still works kind timeline would thats possible jay johnson yes continue focus incremental capacity increases gorgon wheatstone happen expansion debottlenecking actually expand capacity facilities importantly also happens increase reliability facilities utilization higher look year weve supplied cargoes said thats production last year even turnaround see improvement happening seen capacity increases wheatstone gorgon would expect continue move forward operator thank well take next question sam margolin wolfe research sam margolin wolfe research hi good morning jay johnson good morning sam sam margolin wanted revisit lng topic maybe specifically tie permian theres lot resource permian thats commercial includes different zones youre already developing plus areas development calendar nearterm lng didnt historically help expensive obviously things changed would love perspective happens permian resource overall opportunity duration environment add extra capital even commit spread monetize gas doubledigit price jay johnson would characterize determines pace activity permian balance accomplish efficiently factory model way land acquisition deals time fill checkerboards ensure efficient development plan example since weve executed transactions added foot long laterals thats allowed us drive efficiency higher returns activity levels really arent determined much export united states projects would economic much lower prices really price thats unlocking permian developing infrastructure export basin markets supply domestic international done coordinated fashion stay within capability organization execute efficiently safely thats really drives permian nice access additional markets optionality provide advantage working closely midstream group great capability domestic offtake setting potential international export really would view limiting factor pace determine based overall balance free cash flow returns resource reserve replenishment sam margolin okay maybe follow ancillary factors might consideration like opportunity fit another ccus project facility might contribute like flaring mitigation effort anything besides price signal jay johnson pierre said earlier permian actually good carbon intensity scope basis kilograms coe per boe produced across basin benchmarking facilities achieved certification platinum status two midland basin sites project canary provides independent thirdparty certification methane emissions performance talking working chevron technology ventures venture capital arm new energies segment carbon capture sequestration carbon capture particular critically important us world three pilots going san joaquin valley operations capture co thats coming cogen units course gaining experience gorgon quest canada learn takes effectively efficiently sequester co storage going beauty portfolio like put pilot projects demonstration projects wherever makes sense regulatory fiscal return standpoint develop technologies going need going forward pierre breber thanks sam operator irene himona thank well take next question irene himona socit gnrale socit gnrale thank good morning congratulations strong quarter wanted ask first youre seeing ground terms signs persistent demand destruction retail also industrial customer level please pierre breber irene said quickly earlier weve seen would call demand response higher prices second quarter midsingle digits us gasoline little higher us west coast little lower us gulf coast think weve seen recovery since prices come well see third quarter ends diesel hard see price sensitive tied commercial industrial activity maybe little bit response retail diesel jet largely tied recovery air travel think people wanting get see people places asia also retail little variable theres still covid restrictions hard see data whats interesting theres obviously concerns around recession terms tailwinds still low unemployment consumer wants spend money go things havent able couple years prices higher second quarter made choices look demand response gasoline thats line even higher past recession clear guess id say demand much recession resilient going forward weve seen little bit response second quarter diesel tied underlying commercial activity jet really depend airlines get flights scheduled pilots rest challenges happening thats little bit sense demand saw response second quarter seeing come back early third quarter well see goes irene himona thank pierre followup mentioned youre launching new carbon capture projects wanted go back australia ask possibly talk around recent performance gorgon carbon capture project utilization improving read perhaps technical side project ones youre launching thank jay johnson thanks irene gorgon weve stored successfully million tonnes co reservoir ironically biggest issue currently ability remove water sufficient rate storage reservoir create space co enter weve already demonstrated capacity capability inject full co rates reservoir water producing solids contaminants ironically oil gas oil gas basin need surface facilities remove water injected third reservoir new particularly high technology challenges deal everyday life around world compounded little bit gordon sequestration class nature reserve cumbersome process approve additional facilities additional wells problems solvable represent view kind restriction viability carbon sequestration means storing co long periods would expect said learn go teaching us uncertainty ranges reservoir whether youre producing injecting sufficient contingencies mitigations depending find uncertainty ranges actually put facility operation important well need keep mind develop sequestration projects around world science good technology works basic issues face reservoirs around world need overcome operator paul cheng thank well take next question paul cheng scotiabank scotiabank hey guys good morning jay may add congratulations thank help years appreciate jay johnson thanks paul paul cheng two questions first touched inflation different parts business give overview given footprint give us overall view chevrons expectation inflation next year know still early budget talking largest suppliers seem suggest everything used terms manpower equipment dont know whether agree assessment tell us see along supply chain biggest pressure point see least inflationary pressure thats first question second question mexico brazil guys entered think couple years ago blocks havent heard guys talk much rank within portfolio today next step thank pierre breber thanks paul ill take first ill hand jay second onshore us weve seen cost inflation year single digits weve able mitigate part good planning smart procurement good relationships suppliers jay pointed weve able also get efficient drilling completion operations also partially offsets outside us seeing much modest inflation talked gulf mexico offshore rigs contracted time rig rates lower looking toward work right confident well able secure goods services needed program program higher activity program next year includes permian well share estimates seeing terms cogs inflation disclose capex budget december middle work right feel good well goods services need finalizing plans jay jay johnson yes thanks paul terms mexico brazil significant exploration discoveries turning attention would say towards egypt nice exploration position shooting seismic areas unexplored theyve restricted areas available us suriname exploration always going looking next opportunities would say focus primarily shifting toward egypt suriname thanks question operator thank well take last question ryan todd piper sandler ryan todd piper sandler thanks maybe first one biofuel side youve closed regi bunge deals within business talk little bit youre seeing markets whether elaborate broad types commercial opportunities see mentioned prepared remarks pierre breber thanks ryan really excited welcome regs people chevron cj warner board shes already participated first board meeting fantastic great knowledge traditional new energy businesses great add board said early wins wont get details commercial opportunities saw combination strength reg terms feedstock acquisition primarily waste oils combining retail marketing footprint bringing two great teams together seeing youd expect one plus one two weve got renewable fuels business headquartered ames iowa excited closed midjune comment accounting results second quarter results chose convenience day june th youll see saw earnings release youll see q purchase accounting starting third quarter well see reg results reg good second quarter margins bouncing around results largely line expectations geismar continues track thing bunge operating two crushers excited part invested covercress jointly crop wont compete food lots work space work get renewable fuels capability barrels day still ontrack convert diesel hydrotreater el segundo renewable fuel capability work across parts chevrons system combination reg bunge joint venture assets along customer relationships putting together think successful viable renewable fuels business ryan todd thanks pierre maybe final one jay congrats retirement wanted ask higherlevel question upstream project development technology theres pretty significant shift last years way youve approached project development standardization oftentimes smaller capitalefficient style projects ballymore great example lowered cost supply lot especially deepwater pass baton look forward next years things see horizon either strategically technologies may continue drive changes project development technology may drive things forward even whether k kit deepwater surf subsea umbilicals risers flowlines flowline improvements allow longer tiebacks could mean future resource development portfolio jay johnson thanks question pretty exciting mean one bad thing retirement dont get part next steps im excited would start saying think weve accomplished mindset shift chevron throughout workforce focused returns chasing production target continuing run business thinking returns get scale important outcome opportunity set investments capital choose invest getting focused factory model really important us ironically started drilled lots wells places like duri san joaquin valley weve successfully transferred unconventional plays permian dj duvernay argentina actually taking factory model places like gulf mexico call urban planning try steady progression projects developing capability reach mentioned earlier jackst malo putting service multiphase pumps multiphase pumps sit sea floor allow us reach even maybe miles host facility really gives us great capacity make even smaller accumulations economic gives us returns looking extending life major hubs think gulf mexico continue important proving ground technologies exported around world focus standardization focus minimum viable facilities focus capital efficiency scale npv together resulting aligning chevrons technology center continue develop technologies giving us returns going need going forward resource base today team people technology groups businesses im really excited pierre breber hey ryan thanks question miss jay legacy live youll see performance upstream delivering continue deliver roderick green thanks ryan would like thank everyone time today appreciate interest chevron everyones participation todays call please stay safe healthy katie back operator thank concludes chevrons second quarter earnings conference call may disconnect
