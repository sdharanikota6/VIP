things bear mind slowed things demand contracted due pandemic happened ended inventory drilled uncompleted wells ducs grew beyond would kind normal run rate rig fleet weve working back could think normal factory model well always want ducs front completion crews grown larger normal rate weve caught thats pretty efficient first place turn see cycle turn completing wells get production online well moving factory model itll level little bit versus might feel like little bit surge also get nonratable joint venture bookings show contributed strong first quarter course time look would roll continued activity rest year pretty clear well end higher initial guidance put havent stepped program havent stepped number rigs havent stepped spending really function getting machine running underneath theres ongoing efficiency improvements continue see devin mcdermott got thats helpful thanks second question global gas lng portfolio wondering give us update youre looking medium longerterm opportunities given whats going markets specifically im thinking eastern med gas position also whether integration type lng facility us might make sense production growth well mike wirth sure lng everybodys mind days important meeting europes needs important delivering lower carbon energy system globally see strong market near term eastern med wonderful asset two weeks ago visited leviathan platform spent lot time people business theyve recently completed project increase infrastructure access regional markets actually flowing gas egypt result looking number opportunities increase production resource quite prolific includes coal gas switching israel regional supply neighboring countries potential power generation power distribution region floating lng potentially using ullage lng facilities region number different commercial options evaluated worked come mature area high priority us market demand look us clearly weve got lot gas production largely prices henry hub today projects process lng export facilities weve discussions number developers nothing say weve discussions point weve focused pacific basin historically atlantic basin markets look little bit

sachs neil mehta goldman sachs good morning team mike id love perspective oil macro always good read strikes us inventories product oil tight right youve got jet fuel recovering summer well see happens china shale inelastic supply response ultimately resolve nearterm ultimately need solve demand destruction crack flat price oil something missing mike wirth neil youre putting finger levers step back supply always responds slowly demand normal times last couple years gradually move relative sympathy one another youve got storage buffer nearterm imbalances im repeating know saw contraction unlike anything ive seen lifetime really constrain activity sense producing oil world needed lot less wasnt clear time long might last deep would entire industry every segment industry responded weve come pandemic demand growth surged say havent seen come back yet air travel domestic air travel us pretty strong international air travel still ways go recover prepandemic levels china parts world still various stages lockdown various points time havent seen full recovery demand even demand responded quickly supply match overlay host issues independent eps feeling obligation return cash shareholders big integrated companies reprioritized new energy versus traditional energy indicated intend shrink rather grow oil gas production nocs national oil companies go around world everybodys got little bit different situation market stable equilibrium right say inventories quite low demand still strong economies point seem handling point particularly prices move higher think

resuming production one two trains wheatstone first lng day actually second train early may nearly turnaround also turnaround angola lng thatll late second quarter thats really weve got planned year second quarter takes planned turnaround activity essentially majority ryan todd okay maybe second question refining talk guess think headwinds maybe felt first quarter relative headline margins whether lag timing effects secondary products things like talk trends may reverse shift second quarter looking forward think ability kind capture back look second quarter third quarter mike wirth yeah ill take pass pierre might want add something look see downstream business little bit differently positioned peers weve got pretty heavy us west coast exposure heavy asia exposure pretty light middle east europe basins portfolio little concentrated others subject dynamics markets chinas lot kind ongoing lockdowns california frankly little aggressive covid policy longer parts world demand reflected certain degree rising crude market two effects tend roll downstream one way inventory valued rising market tend see negative inventory effects due lifo accounting use also tend see long physical short paper try take price exposure paper marks market physical closes rising market papers marking negative physical obviously gaining see paper physical delivers close paper match rising market two

forward chevron plan build sustainable aviation fuel business thank mike wirth yeah manav obviously aviation demand going grow go forward finding solution one hardest decarbonize segments economy need high energy density aviation fuels planes cant carry much terms cargo area focus traditional refinery distillate portion barrel move molecules diesel kerosene jet fuel renewable diesel investments making theres certain flexibility well ability produce fact weve already produced sustainable aviation fuel el segundo well see coming renewable diesel facilities also got negotiations underway companies different technologies wouldnt necessarily would refinery looking alternate pathways feedstock partnerships pathways going take time come together quality control really important aviation fuels reliability supply really important introduce new feedstocks new technology pathways really diligent ensuring fuel ultimately produce sell going perform engines going consumed last thing ill say none stuff inexpensive sustainable aviation fuel today competitive traditional aviation fuel cost standpoint talk washington various policy incentives could put place encourage sustainability aviation fuel theres letter published whole host people airlines others last week calling action think see scale got keep working technology feedstocks likely sort policy incentives part equation order see capital drawn sustainable aviation fuel manav gupta thank operator well take next question doug leggate bank america doug leggate bank america good morning everyone thanks getting appreciate time mike
