news impact variety issues relative cpc pipeline terminal work going late third fourth quarters two three single point moorings spm work done three spms operational today constraints loading constraints throughput pipe despite lot things people heard worried last year pipeline reliable production impacted less barrels day course year weeks march april everything running smoothly dont see constraints discounts come little bit cpc immediate aftermath sanctions changes related ukraine saw trading range like dated brent conflict began plus minus dollar seeing kind discounts maybe quite preinvasion levels deep immediately afterwards given overall flat price environment way strengthened impact tco relatively muted operator well take next question roger read wells fargo roger read wells fargo thank good morning mike wirth morning roger roger read hey morning guys looking lets call refined product demand talked gas demand earlier im curious look around world weve got positives moving away covid yearoveryear comparison everybodys got high expectations china reopening curious look across operating base youre seeing mike wirth overall roger gasoline demand ill start still touch prepandemic levels fourth quarter maybe fourth quarter look diesel demand pretty flat versus prepandemic jet recovering still highest level kind still flattish recovering precovid think thats concern chinas economy really come return normal level could see increased demand start pull markets youve seen announcements china intention see international flights air travel scheduled much higher levels wed seen long see kind rebound spending activity economy weve seen economies around world thats one things could buoy global economy firm demand products theres still variables equation past

economies china us roger read always big guys followup question come back permian recognize investor day coming pierre sellside dinner end november lot discussion kind changing range really function messaging overall changing way youre developing permian kind following comments things little different bench duc comparisons yearoveryear look different messaging end november something else pierre breber nothing different well show investor day middle range could see fourth quarter permian unconventional production number thousand barrels per day strong learnings mike said weve adjusted plans go deeper targets single bench developments results little longer drilling times rig moves well update thats obviously included production guidance well continue learn adapt permian large royaltyadvantaged position asset delivers higher returns lower carbon big source free cash flow free cash flow growth next five years really driven permian tengiz gulf mexico assets remarkable asset grow rate free cash flow positive whole time free cash flow growing whole time ebb flow little bit learn youll see investor day something consistent saying today said past mike wirth roger emphasize point made earlier another one questions remain focused returns value production thats drives thanks operator well take next question irene himona socit gnrale irene himona thank much taking questions related ask socit gnrale time firstly thinking balance sheet strength course use put youve disciplined timings noble reg see current market two lets say parts legacy oil gas versus low carbon secondly ira act perhaps changed appetite faster expansion low carbon businesses please thank mike wirth thank irene capacity dont need well deals value creating deals interestingly contrast traditional oil gas market new energy market would observe given commodity price strength oil gas weve seen companies previously might languishing value standpoint strengthened think theres optimism eyes companies future bidask spread oil gas companies maybe little wider right given strength versus deal couple years ago lower carbon interest rates rising spacs kind receding like little bit kind froth may come market theres still optimism valuations well well thoughtful careful evaluate lot companies got business models space watch back talk anything thats interesting let touch ira ask pierre add little color ira probably accelerate activity us theres doubt hopefully allow technologies derisked cost technologies reduced attractiveness investments improve bill like kind grab bag different policy incentives doesnt necessarily change longterm view want build businesses perhaps change trajectory businesses become economically viable thats case could feed investment decisions kind second order effect rather first order effect pierre breber add important effects permitting really critical traditional energy super critical new energy new technology developments youve seen us make investments technology reduce cost capture co scale getting costs helpful one element mike said operator well take next question ryan todd piper sandler ryan todd piper sandler maybe could ask couple downstream side first theres lot noise earlier year refinery maintenance activity looking well average us particularly first half year especially amongst independent refiners first quarter guidance seems suggest turnaround activity q thats reasonably light least terribly heavy thoughts whether outlook whole chevron looks normal heavy terms refining maintenance maybe broadly see general tightness global refining markets year course mike wirth would say pretty typical year turnaround activity weve got fcc el segundo first quarter year pierre mentioned comments theres nothing unusual turnaround plan year see across us think markets two things really kind still echoes covid one youre seeing capacity go system two see maintenance deferred covid rescheduled replanned theres probably still bit bow wave pushing system places activity needs get done safety reliability regulatory reasons could driving speculation cant really comment companies plans ill let talk ryan todd thanks maybe side downstream business chemical side clearly weak last little looking forward combination lower natural gas prices reopening china impact see margins moving throughout anticipate oversupply keeps things weaker throughout year mike wirth tend long period cycles part ryan margin think economic growth development china positive dont slide lower part cycle quickly easily generally dont come quickly easily things track longer period time think feels like kind bumping along near bottom dont know theres steep climb opposed gradual climb time operator thank well take next question jason gabelman cowen jason gabelman cowen morning thanks taking questions wanted first follow affiliate distribution guidance taking step higher yearoveryear sounds like due tco excess cash kind billion something

wirth jason venezuela always boots ground limited boots could go could shift sanctions policy opened little room allowed us work pdvsa put people different roles mixed companies little ability influence involvement decisionmaking question state infrastructure theres lack investment number years infrastructure reflects itll take time things turn around seen positive production response already entities involved theyre producing barrels day barrels day since saw change license terms thats good shortterm effect im going say extrapolate today continuing work ground expand production early guide anything also lifting oil bringing us weve got couple cargoes coming pascagoula refinery going delivering cargoes customers gulf coast revenues go series structured channels pay expenses obligations accounting standpoint using costaffiliate accounting well record earnings receive cash point would say cash flows expected modest stepwise change environment going go thoughtfully sixmonth
