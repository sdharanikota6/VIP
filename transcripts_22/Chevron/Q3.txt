update operations going guess noticed one quarter left year looks like youll closer lower end boed guidance range wondering thats design theres external factors driving also noticed morning one integrated peers permian lowered growth expectations mike wirth jeanine numbers say yeartodate total permian production little barrels day first three quarters last year touch barrels day seeing good growth quarter production barrels day versus quarter last year think thing people may miss pandemic drilled uncompleted well inventories really grew rightfully didnt need frac wells bring online declining demand production kept drilling going inventory grew went back work first thing send completion crews start bring ducs online saw back half last year certainly first part year may misled little bit terms rate growth kind surge capacity back factory drilling duc inventory line plan would suggest would seeing production level growth rate kind underlying rate see likely towards lower end range get nonratable bookings nonoperated joint ventures give range expect range dont always hit high end range case well towards lower end changing guidance year forward guidance pierre breber jeanine ill add low end range represents yearonyear growth thats strong growth jeanine wai agreed thank clarification maybe pierre sticking terms comments earlier morning think caught article capex would top end billion mediumterm guidance range know theres lot moving pieces dont know youre going want talk youll release month obvious moving pieces see next year tco spend starting roll absorbed permian know going garner capital next year question capital trending higher end range reflection chevron responding macroenvironment always part plan maybe inflation pushing capital little higher

plans going increase permian locations cost inflation contribute well share details announce december thats increase next year relative think well end year yeartodate little bit capital budget organic basis result increase line guidance consistent increasing investment growing energy supplies mike wirth thanks jeanine operator next question come neil mehta goldman sachs neil mehta goldman sachs good morning mike pierre team thank first question around kazakhstan mike would love perspective youre viewing assets development tengiz think vacating barrels via cpc pipeline mike wirth sure ill start project track complete bulk construction end year change cost schedule guidance complete construction right theres still lot work done risk uncertainty certainly narrowing remaining risks tend smaller scale potential impact moving commissioning systems testing startup activities built new integrated operations control center visited fully operational systems online drilling program complete final metering station online good progress construction side well continue update progress toward wpmp pressure management startup indicated right second half future growth project startup first half cpc pipeline constraints ability move barrels line weve flowed everything weve producing youve probably seen media reports couple single point moorings offline right repairs buoyancy system repairs underway expected completed shortly point everything flowing looks like well continue neil mehta thanks mike mike spent many years downstreamer well great perspective global refining system dont think ever thought cracks would would love perspective terms refining market work way bottlenecks seem existing system means downstream business mike wirth interesting couple years refining sector neil covid actually saw period time refineries shut around world maybe rate greater would expected economics really collapsed demand collapsed refineries us taken offline storm damage operating incidents coming back see others converted renewable diesel constraint reduction refining capacity occurred last couple years way really havent seen previously thing happened new builds various stages development primarily middle east asia slowed covid lot industry slowed activity better view going come period time think come back development eventually online ease global constraints system tight right see maintenance runs long unplanned events weve seen west coast see things like strikes weve seen france recently markets tighten really quickly sends price signal try bring supplies away entire refining complex right little tightly balanced historically think shortterm want call next year plus minus probably stays way maybe little bit longer degree think see new capacity come online get back situation quite finely balanced today doubt market really havent seen probably career terms overall tightness supply demand neil mehta thank sir operator next question come john royall jp morgan john royall jp morgan hey guys good morning thanks taking question thinking buyback range billion per year qs strong quarter fundamental perspective maybe feels repeatable upside case q q still generated free cash flow well excess dividend buyback top end range question think could go billion top end given still good amount deleveraging happening point cycle doesnt seem quite extraordinary q mike wirth yeah john weve actually increased rate buybacks three times year announced first one end last year weve steadily moved range rate repurchases alltime high terms rate share repurchases youre right weve got strong cash flow right allows us support financial priorities maintain strong balance sheet think thing would reemphasize want maintain buyback program throughout cycle procyclical countercyclical want operate across cycle shareholders see consistency us know count positioned way confident maintain regularly reassess view business commodity markets continues evolve well continue apprise anything pierre want add anything pierre breber ill point increased dividend earlier year weve growing dividend compound annual growth rate years first financial priority theres lot attention buyback clearly fourth priority sustaining growing dividend investing grow traditional new energy businesses maintaining strong balance sheet mike said intend across cycle multiple years john royall

footprint anybody im curious youd characterize look across becoming challenging mitigate issues mike wirth like tell people plan work work plan weve indicated frankly go back precovid trajectory pretty much stayed right even interruption covid terms contracting rigs completion crews pipe sand name tend longerterm visibility commit service providers earlier result quality availability people equipment et cetera dont see meaningful constraints ability execute program certainly seeing cost inflation permian probably strongest see around world kind low double digits yearonyear parts portfolio cost pressures probably little bit less constraints arent quite pressing think youll see little bit capital guidance comes wrap planning look next year think probably real dont want call governor constraint pace industry activity ramp get next year hear people talking point view ill let comment real weve seen movie permian weve seen oil sands decade earlier cyclical business part roger read followup question renewable natural gas rng saw big acquisition announced weeks ago front youve one leaders curious look whats going terms legislation thats come federally well extent

mike wirth morning devin devin mcdermott wanted stick new energies first weeks ago announcement joined consortium look hydrogen ammonia project gulf coast wondering could talk little bit detail around broadly inflation reduction act passage youre thinking opportunity set new energy platform next years mike wirth excited announcement work number really good partners try develop hydrogen opportunities gulf coast one things think youre going see new energies businesses evolve going build entire new value chains means going partner different people expertise different parts value chains bring technology bring customers bring experience venture one company necessarily would collectively work people build new value chains early days many things studying different opportunities terms

landscape acquisitions upstream downstream even new energies going forward mike wirth sure devin always looking weve got evergreen process scan different sectors interest us watch companies watch sectors watch opportunities weve pretty high bar weve done deals say feel like deals weve done likely turn well weve got strong portfolio weve got really strong base case dont need deal unless really improves expect deliver otherwise would say going continue disciplined dont open check book even times good like especially times good like walked away deal years ago rather chase value weve sold assets portfolio welltimed say last couple deals done pretty good time time think oil gas business theres likely consolidation need fewer stronger companies normally happens bottom cycle rather top cycle new energies theres lot activity think theres active market could see things come together nobody pieces think look building businesses going find combinations probably necessary actually begin

expectations see saf issue playing us europe maybe update progress geismar renewable diesel facility acquired regi mike wirth sure ill start regi acquisition assets good people better surprises far upside weve already identified quick wins commercial opportunities lowered insurance financing costs integration efforts track delivering expectations seeing placement biodiesel chevrons west coast marketing network continues ramp optimizing freight feedstocks across system builds strength companies renewable fuels value chain see really nice nice combination geismar expansion underway nearly

crush spread bringing feedstocks system working converting hydro processing capacity refineries able run biofeedstocks part business grow economics like anything downstream function feedstock costs supply demand markets theyve good far expect across cycle time theyre going continue important part portfolio seeing people going renewable diesel market like commodity market times may get long margins may reflect familiar dynamics traditional business ryan todd thanks mike maybe one may little speculative thoughts think impact russian product import ban europe could play terms product flows barrels likely find home latin america africa think may actually see decent amount russian product disappear market mike wirth yeah export bans looked within context broader market say weve seen crude

guiding top end range increased course year reflects really two items angola lng affiliate income line generating earnings year first half year cash returned return capital dividend showing different part cash flow statement second item given uncertainty cpc tco holding cash well get cash tco think tco appropriately cautious mike said barrels flowing october expect flow november expect repairs completed shortly said theyre cautious holding little higher cash balance well top end range q billion affiliate dividends q ytd reason youre seeing cash flow line affiliate income less dividends little bit larger maybe youd expect primarily two drivers terms quirks angola lng accounting tco holding cash balances temporary thing expect well see higher cash future mike wirth okay gulf mexico

got st malo waterflood first injection planned next year anchor new greenfield project expect first oil whale another greenfield project operated one partners expect first oil towards end recently took fid second quarter year ballymore project expect first oil one appreciate question oftentimes hear people say well see kazakhstan growth see permian else weve got string projects deepwater gulf mexico kind sequentially lined steadily contribute production growth us deepwater lucas herrmann mike pierre thanks much appreciate mike wirth thank lucas operator next question come biraj borkhataria rbc biraj borkhataria rbc hi thanks taking questions ive got two questions left please first one going back kazakhstan cpc understanding theres sort fortuitous timing tengiz one projects kazakhstan offline allowed tengiz flow despite capacity obviously lower trying understand hypothetically kazakh production comes back full capacity pipeline capacity maintained reduced full capacity projects get pro rata equally quirks need aware relates tengiz second question lng portfolio performed extremely strong quarter say proportion lng portfolio sold longterm contracts proportion sold spot basis either year medium term thank mike wirth cpc mentioned earlier right one three single point moorings operational two maintenance repair work thats well underway would expect work complete able handle full flows cpc long reason didnt happen constrained one spm capacity load cpc move operating full would constraints movements tco long initial largest many ways think important shipper line thats reflected practices dont want get details would still able flow barrels maybe barrels think tco would well positioned disadvantaged let say sort proration underway pierre breber ill add nominations cpc november already put place tco essentially got full nomination even november thats even situation spms repaired course theyre repaired nonissue even stay november tco already received full nomination lng question biraj notionally around contract spot thats combination australia lng operations west africa operations west africa tends almost spot australia closer averages well give

next question come irene himona socgen irene himona socit gnrale thank much good afternoon congratulations strong results first question financial framework clearly manage cycle time current uncertainty commodity price outlook rather extreme partly risks fears recession question look downstream businesses whether us asia seen signs economic slowdown would cause concern look ahead might perhaps drive conservative approach capex growth thank mike wirth irene thanks demand remains pretty strong globally across products barrel variations certainly us west coast refining issues prices reflected saw gasoline demand third quarter responsive higher prices little bit softness diesel demand pretty strong around world maybe little less china given lockdowns theyre seeing aviation demand steadily coming back people flying quite precovid levels yet steadily increasing overall wouldnt say product demand weve seen date sending strong signal recession underway economy significantly slowing said theres always kind regional maybe sectoral unique characteristics really seeing yet irene irene himona thank supplementary question go back renewable natural gas please lcfs prices less halved last year wonder help us understand impact rng create pressures perhaps work technology try reduce costs given value incentive half last year thank mike wirth sure let set incentive aside second every one downstream businesses always working reducing costs improving technology finding ways become efficient thats inherent business dynamics around lcfs credits rins ab credits california eu trading scheme things manage cycles part business related necessarily correlated fundamental supply demand dynamics drive physical flows government allocations credits whether people building inventories credits drawing inventories credits dont necessarily correlate underlying commodity weve got fair amount experience managing certainly economics something like rng rely credit structure regulatory framework incentivized businesses see credits declining value starts erode little bit margin business take longterm view things think regulators see credit values reflect lot length credits
