MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being
recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy
Barnum.
Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57 on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This
quarter, we had two significant items in Corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment
securities losses.
Touching on a few highlights, combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year-on-year with growth in both discretionary and non-discretionary
spending. We ended the year ranked #1 for Global IB fees, with a wallet share of 8%, and credit continues to normalize but actual
performance remains strong across the company.
On page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was
up $8.4 billion or 72%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as
management and performance fees in AWM, lower Auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up
$382 million or 7% year-on-year.
Expenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit
costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm's
macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case, as well as loan growth in Card Services, partially offset by a
reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty.
Looking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion,
and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%.
Onto balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the
benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA. RWA declined approximately $20
billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in Card
Services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached one quarter early. So, given that, we
expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.
Now, let's go to our businesses starting on page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of US consumers and small businesses based
on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data.
Combined debit and credit spend is up 9% year-on-year. Both discretionary and non-discretionary spend are up year-on-year, the strongest
growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year.
E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat. Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to
slowly normalize with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income
segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter this year.
Now, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which was up 29% year-onyear. You'll notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there,
revenue was up 56% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter as spend remains strong
and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships.

2

Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows – where we are seeing
good momentum, including from our deposit customer. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year-on-year, largely driven by lower
production revenue.
Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving
balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20%, and we are
now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in
2023. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%.
Expenses of $8 billion were up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by Auto lease
depreciation from lower volumes. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800
million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending, and net charge-offs of $845 million, up $330 million year-on-year.
Next, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking revenue
of $1.4 billion was down 57% year-on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower
announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions resulting in fees down 58% for debt
and down 69% for equity.
In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and
sentiment about the economic outlook. Also, note that it will be a difficult compare against last year's first quarter.
Moving to Markets, revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12%,
as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets, while Securitized Products continue
to be challenged by the market environment. Equity Markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year.
Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56% and the year-on-year
growth was driven by higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates,
largely offset by lower deposits and market levels.
Expenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full-year basis,
expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower
revenue-related compensation.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up
30% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross
Investment Banking revenue of $700 million was down 52% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion
were up 18% year-on-year.
Deposits were down 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of non-operating deposits. Loans were up 14%
year-on-year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver
utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which
impacts both originations and prepayment activity.
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin
of 33%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances, predominantly offset by
reductions in management, performance and placement fees linked to this year's market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 1% year-onyear, predominantly driven by growth in our private banking advisor teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation.
For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $10 billion, positive across Equities and Fixed Income, and $47 billion for the full year. And in
liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client
assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarteron-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending; while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by the rising rate environment –
resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives.
Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion year-on-year. NII
was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and reflects the two significant
items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year-on-year.
With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on page 10. Okay. We expect total NII
to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in
quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023.

3

Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of the hike in late
December, the hikes expected early in the year, and the cuts expected later in the year should be a net tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the
impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both Wholesale and Consumer.
In addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall Card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving
balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit
balances, given modest attrition in both Consumer and Wholesale.
But it's very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed Funds could deviate from forwards, balance
attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different, and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer
behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships – and may be quite different from what
this outlook assumes. And further, the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year.
That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with existing ones and
as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect sequential NII growth to return, all else being equal. And just to finish up on NII, as the
guidance indicates, we expect Markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates, but remember, this is offset in
Markets NIR.
Now, turning to expenses on page 11. We expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about $81 billion, which includes approximately $500 million
from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers, we expect increases from labor inflation, which, while it seems to
be abating on a forward-looking basis, is effectively in the run rate for 2023. An additional labor-related driver is the annualization of 2022
headcount growth as well as our plans for more modest headcount increases this year – all of which are primarily in connection with executing
our investments.
And on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it's a more modest increase than last
year. The themes remain consistent, and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May. Of
course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while volume- and
revenue-related expense was ultimately a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market
dependent, as always.
Moving to credit on page 12. On the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the company across
Wholesale, Card and the rest of Consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook for Card net charge-off rates specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of
detail about this at a recent conference and our outlook hasn't really changed. So to recap that story, the entry to delinquency rate is the
leading indicator of future charge-offs, and it is currently around 80% of pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of
the year, with the associated charge-offs following about six months later. As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. So while we
anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the
historically low rate of 147 basis points in 2022 but still well below fully normalized levels.
So let's turn to page 13 for a brief wrap up before going to Q&A. We're very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTCE and a record
revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my discussion of the outlook, I've emphasized the uncertainty in many of the
key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performance. So as we look
forward, we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near term and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through-thecycle target of 17% ROTCE.
And with that, operator, let's open up the line for Q&A.

Q

John E. McDonald
Analyst, Autonomous Research

Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the NII outlook slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit costs is quite wide, as you
mentioned. It looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the $74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? Maybe you could
give some color about kind of the drivers of the $74 billion and where that lines up on this range of deposit cost outcomes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Sure, John. I mean, I wouldn't take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That's just supposed to give a stylized indication of the fact that
relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as you well know, can produce quite significant impacts on the NII.
And also that there's, as we've already talked about, a meaningful range of possible outcomes for the year-ahead as the deposit reprice path
remains uncertain.
The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says, and the drivers within that are the usual drivers. In Wholesale, we would expect to see a little bit
of continued attrition, especially of the non-operating type balances, and you're going to see some internal migration there out of non-interestbearing into interest-bearing over time.
In Consumer, CDs are flowing right now, and we're seeing good new CD production. We've got a 4% CD in the market as of this morning. And
so continued CD production, and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it is – well, and, of course, as I said in the prepared
remarks, we do expect – across the company – modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT and the rate cycle and so on.
So we've got best guesses for all of those in the outlook, and of course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and we'll
just run the business this year.

Q

John E. McDonald

Analyst, Autonomous Research

Okay. Thanks. And on buybacks, how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have
and any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah, sure. So, sort of in the mode of like helping you guys out to put a number in the model, if you sort of look at the way we're seeing things,
obviously, we've got another GSIB step coming next year. So, say, a 13.5% target and the sort of using your estimates, organic capital
generation, minus dividends, et cetera, and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion
of buybacks for this year for 2023.
But you know, of course, that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So if we have better uses for the money, those will
come first, and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion, and also noting that we are potentially
going to see a Basel III NPR sometime in the first quarter, or maybe in the second quarter. And while that will be an NPR, and it will only cover
part of the surface area and it won't be final, so it's unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short-term decision-making – there will be some
information content of that release that could shape our decisions as well.

Q

Erika Najarian
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning, appreciate that there is a
significant amount of uncertainty in this year's NII forecast in particular. But to follow up with John's question, I'm wondering if you could give
us sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you're expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit
beta.
I think the feedback I'm getting very early from investors is that they appreciate the headwinds that's occurring for NII this year. At the same
time, you have been consistently beating what seemed like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant $20.3 billion
number in the fourth quarter. So that's why I think the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their
own expectations are versus that.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Thanks, Erika. So, look, I totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we're
trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we're honest, involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve
throughout the year.
I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely – and that's just a level
of precision that we're just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we'll be faced
with as a company are respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with a strategy, which is about growing and maintaining
primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost. So, in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition
across the company for deposits, as I said.
Jamie, you want to add something?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Erika, I just want to give a big picture about why I do not consider $74 billion conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet
by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in T-bills, money market funds, and of course, banks are
competing for the capital money now and banks are all in a different place. And some banks have started to compete heavily. Some have a lot
of excess cash and maybe compete less.
But if you look at prior – and forget what happened in 2016 – I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We've never had zero rates.
We've never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CDs, more migration to money market funds. A lot of people
are there competing for it and we're going to have to change savings rates. We can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are
doing. We don't know the timing, but it will happen.
And I just also want to point out that even at $74 billion, we're earning quite good returns. We've always pointed out to you all that sometimes
we're over-earning and sometimes we're under-earning. I would say, okay, this time we're over-earning on NII this quarter. We're maybe overearning on credit. We may be under-earning on something else. So these are still very good numbers and we're going to wait and see and
we'll report to you. But I don't want to give you false notions how secure it is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Erika Najarian
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

And my follow-up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let's zoom out for a second here – to your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You
mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession, and I'm going to re-ask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think
about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day even with the headwind in NII and the headwind
in the provision?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yes, we can. But a lot of factors determine that. But yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting
number, which is what do we think our ROTCE will be if we have a real recession. Which, I think even in a real recession, it would probably
equal the average industrial company – which is good. So we're going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns,
and we can still grow. And remember, 17% is very good if you can compound – some growth at 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I
also want to point out we don't know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

And, Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point. I just want to be crystal clear about this. So, as you know and as we discussed a lot
through the pandemic, in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it's anchored around our economist central case
forecast, which as you correctly say is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de
facto scenario that's embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective. So we just want to be

clear about that.

Operator: The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Ebrahim H. Poonawala

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Good morning. I guess maybe, Jeremy, just following up on the credit assumptions underlying – if you could give us a sense of what's
assumed in that reserve ratio at the end of the year, be it in terms of the unemployment rate, and your outlook around just a lot of chatter
around commercial real estate, the struggles to reprice in the current rate backdrop. Are you concerned about that? Are you seeing pain points
in CRE customers given what's happening with cap rates and then just overall backlog today?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Sure. Let me just do CRE quickly, Ebrahim. As you know, our sort of multi-family commercial term lending business is really quite different
from the classic office type business. Our office portfolio is very small, Class A best developers, best locations. So the vast majority of the loan
balances in Commercial Real Estate are that sort of affordable multi-family housing, commercial term lending stuff, which is really quite secure
from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons. So we feel quite comfortable with the loss profile of that business.
And so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall. So, as I said, the central case economic forecast has a mild recession,
and if I remember correctly, unemployment peaking at something like 4.9%. The adjustments that we make to the scenarios to reflect slightly
more conservative outlook have us imply a peak unemployment that's notably higher than that.
So I think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances. And the trajectory that we've
talked about in the presentation, they definitely can capture something more than a very mild soft landing. But, of course, it wouldn't be
appropriate to reflect a full-blown hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below 100%.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Ebrahim H. Poonawala

Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Noted. And I guess just as a follow-up – you've managed RWA growth pretty well – when you look at loan growth year-over-year versus RWA,
stayed relatively flat. As we think about just managing capital, how should we think about the evolution of RWA? Are there still opportunities to
optimize that going into whatever the Fed comes out with on Basel? Thank you.
.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. So there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We're continuing to work very hard and it's a big area of focus. Some of that is
reflected in this quarter's numbers, but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items, particularly in
market risk RWA. And yeah, but we should be clear that although we've said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material
economic headwind for the company, they're also not zero. There are real consequences due to the choices that we're making as a result of
this capital environment. And in a Basel III outcome that is unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective, there will be additional
consequences that we obviously are hoping that's not the case and believe that it's not appropriate, but we'll see what happens.

Q

Glenn Schorr

Analyst, Evercore ISI

Hi. Thank you. I'm curious – I want to talk leveraged loans for a second. You've done a good job avoiding some of these – putting on these –
loans for the better half of the last half year. So good call on your part. Things have gotten a lot cheaper. However, bank balance sheets, not
yours, are still kind of mucky-ed up with a lot of the back book. I'm curious to see if things have gotten cheap enough. Do you consider
yourself back in? And how important is this in general for activity levels to pick back up to have available funding from the big banks?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. A couple things there, Glenn. So short answer is we're absolutely open for business there. Terms are better. Pricing is better. We have
the resources needed. We're fully there. No overhang, no issue.
Also, I think there's a bit of a narrative that like activity in the market needs to overcome overhang. We're not convinced that that's true. We
think that the overhang is in the numbers and people need to look forward and the system has the capacity to handle the risks. So I recognize
your point, I think it's an interesting point, but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the overhang from the
perspective of bank's ability to finance activity.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Glenn Schorr

Analyst, Evercore ISI

Interesting. So maybe a bid-ask thing, more so. Okay. Maybe, Jamie, while we have you, in the last annual letter, you talked about low
competitive moats and intense competition from all angles, not just fintech. And I was just trying to think out loud. Is that better or worse, that
competitive landscape, in a much higher rate backdrop? Maybe I'll just leave it at that to see where you go with it.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

No. I think it's the same. You have the Apples who are basically doing a lot of banking services and Walmart starting theirs. And obviously,
higher rates will hurt some of the folks in the fintech world and maybe even help some of the folks. So we expect tough competition going
forward.

Q

Gerard Cassidy

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC

Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Sticking just with private equity for a moment, can you share with us where the risks are in the private equity
markets to JPMorgan – when you think about it from your loan book? Or is it really just in equity investments? And maybe expand upon that.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Sorry. Do you want me to take that Gerard? So just a couple of things. So, Jamie is right, the headwind year-on-year is primarily a function of
the fact that this is an investment that – just because of the management alternative accounting standard – we were forced to mark up
previously. This is an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiatives. So anyway, it's
fine.
The point is there is a small write-down this quarter. And the important point there is that the core business is performing exceptionally well,
both because of higher rates, but also because of the strategy that Takis talked a lot at Investor Day paying off across fees and value-added
services and so on and so forth.
And I guess, Gerard, your question is like private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space, did I hear that correctly?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Gerard Cassidy
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC

That's correct, Jeremy. And just in terms of any lending, obviously, so many of these companies have seen their valuations come down
considerably. Is there any elevated risk lending to some of these companies considering the struggles they're having?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. I mean, I think that's a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company, our exposures to the sort of non-bank financial sector, broadly
defined. And of course, as – we thought a little bit about what normalized Wholesale charge-offs could look like through the cycle. They're
obviously higher than effectively zero, which is what we have now. But we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the
books.

Gerard Cassidy

Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys did a good job building up that loan loss reserve this quarter. Two questions to that. First,
the Shared National Credit exam results are always released in February. Does the reserve buildup take some of that into account? And
second, how much of the reserve build was more of a management overlay versus your base case, the quantitative part of the decision
making for building up the reserve?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah, I mean, I'll give you that answer, but I'm oversimplifying a lot. I would say that...
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon

Oversimplifying.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it. The sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change for all intents and purposes quarter-on-quarter. I
think that's the best way to think about that, Gerard.

Q

Ken Usdin
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering if you can help us understand the ongoing efforts on your mitigation for the RWAs in advance of all
the points you've made already about the pending capital regime. Can you help us understand what type of effects that has, if any, on parts of
the income statement, whether it's NII or the Trading business?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. So, if I just take that one, just assume we're going to have modest growth in RWA and in every single business – mortgages, loans,
derivatives – how we hedge CVA and stuff like that. We take actions to manage RWA. It does not really affect the business that much. It might
one day, but it doesn't affect it today.

Jamie Dimon

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

And so, we don't build in – somehow we lose a little bit of this, a little bit of that. And the biggest opportunity down the road would be a
reopening of the securitization markets. They're still very tight. And I think one day they will reopen.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Ken Usdin

Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Okay. And then on the – one follow-up. Just coming back to the reserving process. Can you just help us understand relative to the 5% peak in
3Q that you gave for your unemployment rate quarterly average and that 3.9% average baseline, where does this fourth quarter reserve get
you to? And just does that rule of thumb that you kind of gave us last quarter still stand in terms of scenario analysis on potential builds ahead
of this mild recession?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. Can I just make it real simple? The base case, okay, is where it hits almost that 5% unemployment. Then you probability-weight other
scenarios. That's why Jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case. We didn't change the probability scenario weighting.
But, of course, it got worse since the base case got worse. That's all it is. Which still is a good benchmark, for you all to keep in mind is if
we've got to a relative adverse case – call that a 6% unemployment – and then once you get there you assume the average weighting – you
have wings. It could get better or it could get worse. At that case, we would need about $6 billion more.
When the base case itself deteriorates, we're moving closer to relative adverse. That's all it is. These are all probabilities and possibilities and
hypothetical numbers. And if I were you, I'd just look at charge-offs, like actual results. And we break this out, but it's hard to describe, and
every bank does this slightly differently and every bank has a slightly different base case and a slightly different weighting of adverse cases, et
cetera. And so, we're just trying to make it as simple as possible.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Ken Usdin
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Yeah, I hear you. The challenge this time is that we're going to have the income statement effect way ahead of that charge-off. So, we're all
trying to just fit for that. But I appreciate that. Thanks, Jamie.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

And once the MEV base case gets to where you expect relative adverse, you'll be adding the $6 billion of reserves before you have chargeoffs.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Ken Usdin
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Exactly. Right.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

And again, and maybe just out of interest – implied in your question might be a little bit – to what extent does this quarter's build sort of, is a
down payment on the $6 billion. And the answer to that question is, much less than all of it because a lot of it was driven by loan growth. But
since some of it, as Jamie says, is driven by the flow-through of the downward revision of the central case, you could say – subject to the
caveat that this is a little bit art, not science – that there's some down payment on the $6 billion.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Betsy L. Graseck

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

I wanted to understand a little bit about how you're thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year. I know we talked
already about how it's hard to predict NII, obviously Markets has pushes and pulls. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about
delivering operating leverage, where the elements of the expense base are needing to be invested in so you really can't touch, and where
there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a weaker rev line you can still deliver positive operating leverage?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Sure. So, I mean, as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories. And in some sense, the category
that you're addressing is the volume- and revenue-related expense, which we highlight because it should, pretty symmetrically, respond to a
better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage.
So, for example, in this year's ultimate outcome and the number that we wound up printing for 2022, the year-on-year change in volume- and
revenue-related expense, we're still refining the numbers, we'll probably show you more at Investor Day, but is probably close to $1 billion – in
other words, year-on-year decline. Whereas next year we're assuming something more like flat. So, while the sort of year-on-year dollar
change in the outlook sort of 2021 to 2022, 2022 to 2023 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually.
And so, for example, if we wound up being wrong about the type of environment that we're budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop
in the volume- and revenue-related expense number that's in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest
of it, we're always generating efficiency, and we've worked just as hard at that whether the revenue environment is good or bad.
And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so, broadly, our investment plans really shouldn't be that sensitive to short-term changes
in the environment. Of course, certain types of things like marketing investments in the Card business in particular, the math of what we
expect the NPV of those things to be through the cycle may change in a downturn, and that could produce lower investment, all else equal.
But the core strategic investments that we're making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and
downs of the environment.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Betsy L. Graseck
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Okay. And part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on JPMorgan's stock has been around the capital charges, the capital
margin, will capital be a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years. As you deliver on the positive operating
leverage side, it gives you room to absorb some more capital, obviously, and still hit those IRR and ROTCE targets on incremental
investments.
Maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage you're expecting to
generate. And maybe that's an unfair question today and it's a better question for Investor Day, but that's kind of the debate that's out there on
the stock.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

I get it. I get it. I mean it's a fair question, it's a good question. I'm not going to answer it super specifically, and Jamie may have some views
here, too. But let me just quickly say we've kind of said that we feel quite confident about this company's ability to generate 17% through the
cycle, and that's incorporating our sense of the current environment, the operating leverage that you talked about, and the expectation of
higher capital requirements with the 13.5% target in the first quarter of 2024.
The question of whether Basel III end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce
those returns is, of course, impossible to answer right now, but I would remind you that it's not just denominator expansion. Unreasonable
capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy which goes into the numerator, too. It's not what we want, but that is a possible
outcome.

Q

Mike Mayo
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Hi. Yeah. I recognize you're evolving your business model and you're spending money to make more money and that your track record last
decade was strong there. But as it relates to the Frank acquisition that's been in the news, I'm just wondering what that says about the
financial discipline for the 15 deals that you pursued, the $7 billion of investing each year, and the one-fifth increase in expenses over three
years to your guide of $81 billion in 2023. So, it's really a question about financial discipline. And I know you can't go into details on the Frank
deal, and, look, you earn the purchase price in two days. Okay. So, I get that.
And if there's fraud – you can't do anything about fraud, but still it diverts management resources and attention. So, maybe, just in the
specifics, as it relates to the acquisition strategy, like who sources them? Who negotiates them? Who does the due diligence? Who runs it?
And ultimately who is accountable for all these 15 different deals? And when you're having investments going across business lines, which is
a strength of you guys, but who is ultimately accountable when these investments don't go the way you want to?
And, Jamie, you recognized a couple years ago at Investor Day, you said, look, sometimes you're going to waste money as you're innovating
and you're growing. But ultimately who is accountable when an investment doesn't go right, like the Frank deal or another deal or some of the
other $81 billion that you expect to spend this year?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. Obviously, Mike, that's a very good question which we’re always concerned about – because we've always talked about complacency
and all things like that. So, obviously, when you're getting up to bat 300 times a year, you are going to have errors. And we don't want our
company to be terrified of errors that we don't do anything and that the complacency is then burdened by bureaucracy which is stasis and
death. So, you have to be very careful when you make an error like you’re going to cripple the firm.
We are very disciplined, and you see that in a lot of different ways. You see it in our leverage lending book. You see it in the success of our
investments. You see it in the quality of our products and services. You see it in all these things. And there's no difference for an acquisition.
There are – so the acquisitions are done by the businesses, but there's also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence. So, the
business does it. The centralized team does it. We've been doing it for 20 years, wasn’t like we just started doing something like that. And,
obviously, there are always lessons learned.
And at one point, we'll tell you the lessons learned here when this thing is out of litigation, but we're quite comfortable. And the people who are
responsible are the people in the business. So, if that business did the acquisition, they are responsible. They report back, and we expect
people when they talk to all of us is the good, the bad, the ugly. We're never looking for how great everything was. And obviously, this thing, in
one way or another, was a huge mistake.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Mike Mayo
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Let me follow up on that. So, that relates to the inorganic growth. As it relates to the organic growth, such as in the Payments business, which
I know is a focus – that cuts across a lot of different business lines. So, as you invest more in Payments, which can be a 20 or 30 P/E
business, which could be great if you got there – who is responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across? Sometimes the way
you aggregate the data, it's Consumer, it's to the Investment Bank, it could be Asset Management, it could be Commercial, it could be
everything in the Payments. Who's responsible for those?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

13

A

Jamie Dimon

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

So, just to be clarified, so I would say that Marianne and Jenn, when it comes to credit, debit, checks, and all the consumer-related stuff. And
Takis, which I think, you saw the presentation about Payments at Investor Day, reporting to Daniel, and that is on the Wholesale Payments,
Merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff. And those are direct responsibilities. It's quite clear this is an area that cuts across the company.
So, there is a Payments working group that just spends time on that.
That working group has not done an acquisition, okay? And if they want to invest, which there are cases by the way, and you'll see more this
year, they’re decided jointly, and all the way up to Daniel and me.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Mike Mayo

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

And then last follow-up to my first start, the general comment. I mean, this is the third year in a row of about $5 billion of expense growth. And
you have slide 11 there, but I mean, that's a lot of certain front-loaded expenses for less certain back-ended benefits. How's your comfort level
that you're going to see those back-ended benefits, relative to the past?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Totally. And we tried to show you guys at Investor Day. For every branch we open, for every banker we hire, for every tech thing we do, we're
pretty comfortable. There are certain things more like infrastructure, like getting to the cloud and stuff like that, which you can't identify all of
that. But we're pretty comfortable. And if they weren't working, we’d change them.
So, we ask ourselves that question every day – when you're adding wealth managers or branches or certain things. And marketing is half of
that, not quite half, but half of that number. That's a very specific, for the most part, a very specific dollar in, how many dollars out. Not a
guess. And we're pretty accurate at that kind of stuff. And again, if there's $1 billion that we were spending didn't give us the return, we would
cut the billion.

Q

Steven Chubak

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Hi. Good morning. So, wanted to start off with a question on the outlook for Trading and the Investment Banking businesses. Just, Jeremy,
given the strong pipelines you cited, was hoping you can provide some additional color just in terms of what you're hearing from corporate
clients, especially in the context of the mild recession scenario you outlined, when you would expect to see some inflection in Investment
Banking activity. And similar question on the Trading side – you're facing difficult comps in the coming year, we still have QT, rate volatility
proxy is still elevated. Do you anticipate a significant moderation in Trading activity or not?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Sure. Thanks, Steve. So, let's do Banking first. So, I think the thing that's interesting about banking right now is that the declines have been so
significant, obviously from very elevated levels, but even relative to just 2019, 2022 was a relatively weak year. And as we look into 2023, it's
possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in 2022. So, that could conceivably make you pessimistic about the
Investment Banking wallet outlook. And to be sure, it's not as if we're super optimistic.
But it's important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things changed in 2022, specifically with respect to rates, as that affects the
debt business and valuations as it affects M&A and ECM as well. And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide
to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuations in the open market. So, I think there's a chance that that actually winds up helping in
2023 in the Investment Banking wallet. Of course, we don't know, but those are some of the things that we're thinking about.

14

A

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Similarly, on the Markets side, obviously Markets had another very strong year, better than we'd expected. Since the numbers were so strong
coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw. And 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the
active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit. And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continued Markets.
As we look towards 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the
other hand, it's not like the volatility is going away, and Markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And a 4.5%, 5% rate environment is
probably one where there's more trading opportunities than a 0% rate environment.
So, of course, we don't know. We'll see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. The numbers are really very
strong in Markets. But we'll see. We'll see what happens.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Steven Chubak
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

That's really helpful color. And just for my follow-up on finalization of Basel III, sorry Jeremy, I couldn't help myself here. But in Barr's
December speech, he strongly hinted at capital requirements moving higher for you and peers. You also alluded in your comments, or in a
response to one of the questions, that the finalization of Basel III can potentially be very punitive.
Given the absence of the proposal, I was really just hoping you could speak to how you're scenario planning for the eventual finalization and
any additional detail you can offer on the areas of mitigation. I think the one issue or area of confusion is that one of the biggest sources of
RWA inflation is op risk, which can't really be mitigated. So, what are the actions that you can take to really offset some of those potential
headwinds?
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah. So, Steve, I'd love to get into a whole lot of detail here. But I just think that the question of how to mitigate is really hard to discuss in a
lot of detail until we see an actual proposal. And the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases of you studying this issue closely
is, just to point out, that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in all of the different moving parts of this thing – it’s a
very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole. And given how strong the system is today, that just like doesn't
make sense to us. So, we just want to say that. But yeah, Jamie, please.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

I mean just, look, you guys know the operating risk, capital, the trading book, the CCAR, G-SIFI, all those moving parts. Let's just see what
they are. We'll deal with them when we get there, and then we'll figure out what we have to modify our business and stuff like that. We don't
think it's necessary to increase capital ratios. We're quite clear on that.
One of the new numbers we put on the top of the press release was our Total Loss Absorbing Capacity. So, we have now almost $500 billion.
I mean, really, like at one point, when is $500 billion of that, of $1 trillion liquidity, are all those things enough? But let's just see what it is.
They're going to work it through. There are international laws, there are international requirements. We're hoping that America is the same as
international. That would be nice. G-SIFI is supposed to be corrected. We'll see if that happens. So, let's just see. We don't have to guess. And
if the number's too high, we're going to tell you what we're going to do about it.

.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Matt O'Connor
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

Good morning. How are you guys thinking about managing the securities book given the outlook of lower deposits? Obviously, the yield curve
is quite inverted depending on what part you're looking at or most parts, frankly. And then at the same time, the securities book is cash flowing
a lot less than it was a couple years ago, just given the rate environment.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yes. Remember, the securities book is an outcome of investing in basically excess deposits. And you have like $2.4 trillion deposits and $1
trillion of loans and things like that. And we manage it to manage interest rate exposure, all these various things.
And then when you say the size of it, we forecast – which I'm not going to give you the numbers – we forecast every quarter what we're going
to buy, what we're going to sell, how much is coming in, how much we need for liquidity, and we adjust it all the time based upon deposits
coming down and loans and stuff like that. Obviously, what you get to invest in is at much higher rates today. And you see JPMorgan's loss in
the HTM loan book as a percent is much lower than most other people. We're kind of conservative there, too.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Matt O'Connor

Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

I guess a bigger picture question – we've seen such a drop in really 5, 10-year part of the curve and even further out. And banks aren't really
buying; instead they're selling. And I guess I was wondering if you had thoughts on who's buying and what's driving the rates so much lower
than most people think they should be at.
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Yeah, we do. But you should read – get the analyst reports to get that. We look at what everybody's doing: pension plans, governments. We
look at every part of the curve. We look what other banks are doing. I think I already mentioned earlier in this call, banks are in different
positions. Some may have to sell securities to pay off their loan books. We obviously don't. So, people are in a different position.
And as Jeremy pointed out, it's very important, that yield curve will not be the same six months from now as it is today. While we use that to
kind of look forward, it's not actually our forecast. We know it will be wrong. But the investment portfolio will be invested when there are
opportunities. We bought a lot of Ginnie Maes when there was a 60 OAS spread. We sold – one of the reasons we take securities losses is
because that gives you 10-plus billion dollars you can reinvest at what you think are more attractive securities.

Yeah. Andrew, well, I think we've talked about CECL quite a bit. And I think there's some decent color there in terms of Jamie's $6 billion over
a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today. We're definitely not going to get into the business of giving you
an outlook for a sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance. It's appropriate today, and it will evolve as a function of the environment.

Andrew Lim

Sure. Okay. Let's drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments you made there, Jeremy. So, if I heard you correctly, I think
you are sort of talking about sequential increases in NII, so I guess looking towards like $20 billion plus for 1Q, maybe even 2Q. So, I guess
we're hitting about $40 billion for 1H and then a sharp drop-off as, say, deposit costs increase and maybe we get a few Fed Fund rate cuts as
well. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?

Jeremy Barnum

Yeah, no. So, let me uncontroversially say no there, Andrew, just for the avoidance of doubt. So, look, my comments about sequential
increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which you are somewhat correctly drawing from the slide, which is that, in a world
where we're exiting the fourth quarter run rate at $81 billion, or $80 billion ex Markets or whatever, and we're telling you $74 billion for the full
year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We're simply saying don't project
those into the future in perpetuity. Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. Does that make sense?

Right. Got you. Yeah. No, no, no, sure. Absolutely. That makes sense. That's great. Thanks for that.
