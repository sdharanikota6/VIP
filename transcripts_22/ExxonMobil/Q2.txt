drive shareholder returns throughout cycles focus fundamentals unchanged continue leverage core capabilities advance strategic priorities make investments needed long cycle business constancy purpose consistent approach successfully address dual challenge providing energy products modern society needs lowering societys greenhouse gas emissions leading industry energy transition thank jennifer driscoll thank darren please note going move qa session continue ask analysts call limit single question fit questions people however please remain line case need ask clarifications jennifer could open line questions please operator thank mrs driscoll question answer session conducted electronically youd like ask question please pressing star key followed digit one touch tone telephone well take first question neil mehta goldman sachs neil mehta thank team one macro question one micro question darren want continue theme energy security youre one largest energy providers europe would love perspective european energy challenges faced right continent ultimately work way exxonmobils role providing energy region darren woods sure well good morning neil think youre touching challenging situation today reflects think complexity associated making massive change system thats critically important peoples lives think going forward seeing happening today id say broader net cast respect think transition evolves making sure weve got diversified portfolio energy sources energy dependent anyone nation state think important step seeing taken think therell drive time make sure theyre leveraging resources available ill make know one example would potential see fracking unconventional gas germany think industry proven years unconventional gas produced safely secure source supply economically reliable source supply think theres opportunity certainly exxonmobil could play key role also fairly large refining footprint europe weve working hard upgrade facilities make sure driving emissions footprints zero developing plans within current crisis really stepped efforts reduce consumption natural gas fact look refining circuit reduced use natural gas thats equivalent gas used powering million homes europe substantial steps take respect optimizing current operation longer term opening looking projects expand lng import facilities course bringing lng projects online weve got golden pass project us allow us export lng us europe weve got mozambique thats coming back end year course weve got work going png bringing lng supplies help offset russian gas going europe another really critical step forward diversification supplies europe neil mehta thanks darren followup around capital returns talk us talk youre thinking dividend hasnt reset year least whether makes sense return back dividend growth return capital strong buyback number quarter thinking tracking towards billion outlined couple months ago kathy mikells sure im happy take look know first priority continue invest business talked last quarter fact expected build cash balance billion gives us strong balance sheet strong cash balance view competitive advantage provides us flexibility throughout cycle trying strike right balance terms share repurchases dividends know raised quarterly dividend cent fourth quarter last quarter tripled size share repurchase plan billion share repurchases year next definitely focused efficient look return capital shareholders obviously share repurchase program secondary benefit reducing nominal size dividends id say trying strike right balance board reviews pretty regularly feel good right neil mehta thank kathy kathy mikells thank jennifer driscoll reminder single question per analyst please jennifer operator go next doug leggate bank america doug leggate thank good morning everyone thanks taking questions darren wonder could ask first natural gas europe specifically european gas production obviously come bit years sequentially second quarter normally see seasonal trend guys summertime think european gas production going forward obvious reasons flat line wonder could address specific issues around whether groningen could revisited dutch government getting everything thats going darren woods sure good morning doug good hear respect demand youre right go back time normal circumstances see seasonal decline second quarter gas demand thats historically numbers tend foreshadow first quarter typically year obviously circumstances europe different actually foreshadow first quarter didnt expect see kind seasonal dip shortages seeing europe time think going forward obviously big question mark whole landscape supply picture shapes europe also obviously big factor gas demand weather think wouldnt take quarter new norm think weve got stay attuned landscape develops supply looks like obviously keep eye weather respect question groningen capacity something dutch government obviously control evaluates circumstances makes decisions terms production request joint venture nam produce thatll function dutch government weighs demand gas versus supplies role theyre finally going play capacity doug leggate okay thank kathy wonder quick

shareholder returns cycle generate highest value shareholders focused doug leggate thanks kathy breakeven point salient thank operator well go next devin mcdermott morgan stanley devin mcdermott great good morning thanks taking question wanted ask permian business specifically continue pose strong results comments posted prepared remarks think bit acceleration increase activity broadly short cycle back half year think thats referencing permian specifically im wondering could comment reference refers acceleration activity versus prior plans also think outlook next several years could talk little bit inflationary trends youre seeing shale business also ability offset efficiency gains darren woods yeah well good morning devin ill touch see kathy anything add respect permian plan laid time ago currently executing hasnt changed slight rampup head year nothing significantly different plans place deliver current production line growth versus last year know top growth year saw package look tight oil production us versus expect end three times level production would say strategy remains place plans executing remain place looking opportunities within construct define extend expand activities frankly given tightness market availability rigs theres whole lot opportunity move maybe ill ask kathy cover inflationary topic kathy mikells yeah overall id say feel really good managing inflation date overall structural cost savings kind plan program much track know quarter billion overall savings kind relative feeling pretty good know look kind costs year year basis obviously kind seasonal increase cost sequentially little bit planned maintenance activity feel good executing consistent plans remain track know obviously immune inflation great job certainly pandemic especially think kind longer projects global project group executing terms ensuring point time deflationary environment really working hard service providers extend contracts looking revise schedules associated projects still moving engineering forward things could spool market environment improved feel good capex programs overall feel good cost savings driving know id also say isnt always going look exactly kind quarter quarter obviously made significant changes organizational structure put place april time also drive additional efficiencies us working constant id say pipeline area ensure driving greater efficiency across business also effectiveness equally important id say feel really good devin mcdermott great thanks ill leave get back track one question operator well go next stephen richardson evercore isi stephen richardson great thank good morning darren wondering could talk little bit refining outlook probably volatile environment weve seen long time certainly less asian exports certainly china whats going europe wondering could maybe talk based background insights would helpful darren woods sure happy stephen thanks calling say volatile area think thing thats really changed refining landscape impacted know seeing impact across lot industries parts business pandemic go back since weve mentioned prepared presentation million barrels day refining capacity come circuit since pandemic typically happened three times rate historical levels typically historical levels offset new builds coming course lot new builds got pushed pandemic lack revenue extremely negative poor refining margins weve created hole lot capacity coming offline without whole lot new capacity typically developing parts world asia middle east capacitys coming weve got gap demand recovers dont capacity meet led record high refining margins think solution time additional capacity come pleased justified fairly large expansion beaumont refinery essentially based transportation differentials generated reasonable return potential upsides times tight markets obviously going seeing bring refinery expansion biggest expansion decade us one takes advantage utilities units already connection permian advantaged project coming onto market really good time outside dont see whole lot additional expansions us mentioned presentation next two years probably million barrels day capacity including site coming onto marketplaces still fairly short capacity came view going see say tighter supply demand balance know one real question marks happens demand would tell even levels market relatively tight expect tighter market maybe elevated margins versus historical norm would expect much lower weve experienced second quarter time well see capacity come back asia middle east world market efficient barrels flow demand centers balance things think year price environment well get back think typical refining industry structure stephen richardson thanks much appreciate darren woods bet operator well go next jeanine wei barclays jeanine wei good morning thanks taking question darren woods good morning jeanine jeanine wei good morning darren question maybe moving asset side things guyana exxon really tremendous success resource perspective point maybe adjusting thinking timelines given really good execution youve far guess going know phase come faster capacity creeping meantime inflow opportunities continue look really promising point kind compressing timelines thank darren woods thank jeanine well youre right know seen really good progress whats happening guyana think illustrates one advantages consistency approach moving one development know started liza smaller concept get started recognize would build extend design concept design one build many obviously discoveries mature get better understanding reservoir development opportunities adjust designs think function really development plans weve put place right project efficiently develop resources change move around block different structures resources wouldnt say think stay tuned plans mature get better line sight well give updates let know see coming think payara bring one forward announce recently given progress making continue progress ones well update rest market see things coming together im encouraged feel good progress making hope see continued advancement bringing projects forward faster jeanine wei thank darren woods thank operator well go next sam margolin wolfe research sam margolin good morning thank question low carbon side earnings release nice reminder list projects youve announced youre involved earlier week bill drafted senate addressed key categories low carbon carbon capture hydrogen biofuels know youve said scope low carbon business youre interested sort reacting policy want ahead things want try anticipate incentives come wonder bill aligned anticipated assuming passes think zone efforts really going supported think theres work regions might better opportunities us thank darren woods sure thanks question think timely relevant would say weve talking pleased broader recognition comprehensive set solutions going needed address challenges energy transition discussion evolving wind solar evs carbon capture storage biofuels hydrogen really important recognition globally governments particularly government important technologies need developed importantly markets needs catalyzed early investments incentivized think really important development im really familiar whats legislation since come think encouraging see recognition desire try catalyze investments space weve said think theyre going absolutely critical society achieve longer term ambitions make significant reductions emissions step right direction portfolio trying develop diversified approach weve got many projects within portfolio reduce emissions economically total returns portfolio course dan running low carbon solutions working hard improve upon weve got large projects anticipate incentives coming either market policy started planning development policy develops well project ready moving execution blue hydrogen one thatll beneficial incentives come pass given concept id say generally step right direction would also tell moving beyond us broadly looking around world much significant serious effort terms looking opportunities carbon capture hydrogen ammonia space biofuel space ive pleased interest governments around world partners around world engage exxonmobil leverage capabilities bring space help develop large scale projects make significant reductions emissions id say really positive vectors space feel good positioned sam margolin thank operator go next jason gabelman cowen jason gabelman morning thanks taking question wanted ask current investment environment given whats going geopolitically russia think theres two schools thought one kind accelerating push invest new lower carbon energy current energy system geopolitical risks another one fact need invest hydrocarbons world clearly short im hoping could kind frame broadly think industry government conversations gone think crisis currently accelerating push towards greener energy hydrocarbons thanks darren woods yeah bet jason think know short answer yes incentivizing think think thats appropriate look theres opportunity take advantage ill call natural endowments terms sun wind deploy technologies renewable technologies generate power time think theres recognition deficiencies technologies offer important solution necessary theyre sufficient think time recognition need particularly gas given cleaner footprint think recognition speaking sam know challenge emissions oil gas combustion oil gas emissions associated dealing emissions carbon capture storage another opportunity address problem much lower cost much quicker timeframe know sense conversations im governments around world recognition broader approach basket technologies going needed emphasis put ones right reasons right time consciously explicitly recognizing deficiencies making sure mitigating deficiencies europe conversation government leaders clearly recognize challenge associated renewables wind solar intermittency issue recognition gas gas powered fire power generation important backstop address intermittency think theres much holistic approach taken thoughtful one think thats encouraging jason gabelman thanks darren woods bet thank operator well take next question biraj borkhataria royal bank canada biraj borkhataria hi thanks taking questions one quick followup one question followup groningen understand government decision talked technical capacity increase volumes able quantify capacity past field produced sort bcm historically many many years ago question comments liza mentioned first phase producing design capacity asked quarters ago papua new guinea also producing capacity quite good track record increasing nameplate capacity could talk opportunity liza potentially quantify far capacity could go additional units presumably targets based design capacity itd good get color thank darren woods yeah bet biraj would say groningen theres significant capacity obviously theres balance struck know dutch government focused responsible production think wont limit capacity itll limit government thinks necessary produce given circumstances dont know theres wouldnt think capacity limit respect facilities want try balance risk rewards associated production field expansion going design capacity would tell pleased frankly proud organization work theyve done really across entire portfolio mentioned liza png really good examples ones weve highlighted would tell almost new projects bringing line get running teams get quickly focused debottlenecking optimizing taking production capacity think weve got long history think way organized technology engineering organization leverage learnings capabilities competencies every part organization onto one particular asset huge huge competitive leverage fact thats part improvements seeing fact png brought historical downstream optimization technology upstream traditionally upstream facility thats making big difference seeing across number different platforms dont new number give terms think would tell feel comfortable organization going continue push strive getting kit build projects bring online well give updates moving organization successful well let know growing production biraj borkhataria could say far nameplate capacity liza producing kathy mikells biraj borkhataria thank operator well go next roger read wells fargo roger read yeah thanks good morning maybe coming back couple policy questions asked slide five presentation right shows investment maybe versus projected im curious think policy talked maybe checking box youre meeting various governments would allow global investment get back track necessary look several years wouldnt indicate going looking multiple years normal lets call mid cycle commodity prices think breakeven maybe know mid cycle investment situation says oil prices likely exceed doesnt set exxon well think questions asked earlier know aggressive cash returns front curious think sliding together darren woods yeah well think roger complicated space youre asking good one think time policy makers focus think real challenge energy transition dealing emissions broader door opens say carbon capture storage hydrogen specifically blue hydrogen opens door additional oil gas receptiveness oil gas coming marketplace think frankly important given cost associated transition find ways use existing infrastructure dont rewire entire industrial processes power generation systems thats going win society bring emissions may open door think thats time tell obviously demand changes maybe incentivizes investment gets back range thats shown chart perspective know change investment finding advantaged opportunities think view continues going look opportunities leverage capabilities competitive advantage corporation generate industry average returns portfolio weve advancing weve got others working potential opportunities pipeline think successful securing opportunities developing youll see come portfolio frankly size investment function big number projects find advantaged thats kind would summarize roger read ask one kind clarification think understand youre lot things lot different places think investment relative various lines right whats projected whats necessary exxon today feel exxon fits curve darren woods well would say roger youve got put today weve got plan going forward context weve last five years recall back talked aggressively investing opportunities counter cyclically others pulling back leaning meant spent recall got lot pressure criticism spending money front cycle think paying today think right strategy ramp spending heat moment heat market strategy paying youve got look across time cycle would say aggregate investments weve making expectation well continue see cycles industry going continue look opportunities particularly cycle bring advantage investments forward thats way going thinking looking roger read thank operator well go next neal dingmann truist neal dingmann morning thanks time darren question shareholder returns specifically given massive amount cash books post quarterly cash flow would consider externally ramping shorter cycle return assets like permian position given based number looks like notable discounts many independent producers trading versus strip darren woods yeah terms organic opportunities permian going step outside strategy developed terms driving capital efficient production permian youll recall weve talked corridor approach pursuing delaware fact weve preinvested facilities weve got aggressive technology program weve working time thats built brought production drilling one reasons seeing advances cost efficiency driven lot work weve technology space weve got technology looking bring thats helping development productivity development dont want get far ahead lot parameters keeping eye make sure deliver commitments produce low cost low breakevens high cash flow thats way thinking neal dingmann thoughts like think buying externally buying assets outside market position already darren woods think always looking acquisition opportunities thats always radar know key advantage got find assets fit advantages bring additional value accrued value acquisition absolutely remains radar think work technologies advance processes techniques opens additional advantage look apply potential opportunities thats kind formula keeping eyes open neal dingmann well thank darren darren woods bet thank operator well go next manav gupta credit suisse manav gupta hi guys quick question hearing worries debate us recession recession globally also debate im trying understand whether refining business chemicals business seeing early signs recessionary demand kicking demand destruction whether relates refining business maybe commodity chemical business could help us understand demand trending somewhat challenging gdp global economic data thank darren woods sure manav ill take crack see kathy anything add think know certainly dialogue ive heard externally space complex picture try dissect understand course debate recession recession think part factor complicated landscape looking would say within industry less complicated think lot supply constraints logistics challenges facing difficult get real clear read whats driving variation demand quarter quarter month month given logistics challenges seeing inventory withdrawals builds complicated space think bottom line wouldnt tell seeing something would say recession near recession would also say complex picture frankly demand destruction question ask wouldnt tie seen obviously earlier year prices really spiked level discretionary demand saw demand come high prices prices come back youre seeing recover would say thats normal price response see respect demand tied say macroeconomic picture dont know kathy anything add kathy mikells thing would add overall look demand recovering lows pandemic one laggards jet obviously know jet continues lag obviously starting pick people starting travel obviously international travel restrictions reduced means people also starting travel bit internationally continue also see effects covid fact china lockdowns second quarter certainly kind impacted chemical business little bit saw bit volumes coming specifically asia responding theres going continue impacts ongoing recovery pandemic obviously covid impacts kind intersecting bit uncertainty associated overall macro environment last thing id say tend organization prepares worst hopes best tell certainly preparing every eventuality manav gupta thank responses congrats great quarter darren woods thank kathy mikells thank operator well take next question john royall jp morgan john royall hey good morning thanks taking question question chemicals business know youve headwinds q margin volume perspective called china lockdowns specifically piece might little tough forecast speak outlook second half us globally chemicals business darren woods sure ill start see kathy wants add anything would tell know seeing second quarter weve made reference ethane advantage us north america still advantage versus rest world gas prices go crude prices moderate naphtha advantage weakens saw respect margin still reasonably healthy demand good demand growth year year china obviously important market move lockdowns impact chemicals demand automotive market important market challenges theyve chips production issues short term impacts well see get resolved expectation gets resolved automotive production pick wed see recover within portfolio thats kind landscape see today really function china end going respect response covid kathy anything add kathy mikells yeah thing would add look forward supply coming chemicals specifically see projects targeted china china obviously long term one fastest growing markets chemicals also seeing additional supply thats going come north america obviously part cyclicality business supply tends come large chunks takes little overall supply demand come back balance thats thing would add jennifer driscoll thanks think time one question jennifer operator looks like time one question last question ryan todd piper sandler ryan todd yeah thanks maybe one followup earlier comments low carbon businesses carbon capture front call number projects release youre progressing number different projects around world look mean would describe commonalities projects isnt working carbon capture technical similarities driving progress locations specific progress projects political fiscal support key things need see either technically regulatory wise grow business darren woods sure yeah thanks ryan think know look todays technology applicability economic concentrated streams co move seriatim emissions speak co concentration becomes dilute existing technology becomes expensive think thats one key challenges one areas working technology organizations developments technology allow economic capture dilute co streams would say thats one constraint thats going require technical advances make affordable going forward outside within streams necessary concentration make existing technology work key variables storage access storage access storage thats geographically close logistically close another key point transportation cost kind requires concentrated streams co good logistic systems storage abundant storage thats close put things together youve got equation make projects work relatively modest incentive schemes fact thats youre seeing houston hub carbon capture project weve tabled large source somewhat concentrated co streams thats logistically close good storage gulf mexico equations come together require additional incentives something would reasonably inexpensive compared cost societys currently bearing remove co move around world projects looking similar constructs make projects viable obviously governments looking kind policy would required help support projects ryan todd thank jennifer driscoll thank ryan thank darren think time appreciate everybodys questions today post transcript q session investor website early next week nice weekend everybody ill turn back operator conclude call jennifer darren woods thanks operator concludes todays
