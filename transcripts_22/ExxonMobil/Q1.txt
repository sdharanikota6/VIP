permian im thinking two look middle latter part decade darren woods yeah good morning roger would say resource mix depending youre within stabroek block mix changes development priorities weighted toward liquid think youll see plans way talk theres bias toward liquid today time well see developments evolve things government guyana bring gas onshore help deliver costefficient environmentallybetter power people guyana give much lowercost energy source much cleaner energy source development gas space would say generally liquids weighted obviously move field run economics well develop resources optimize capital grow returns roger read thank operator right next question come line ryan todd piper sandler ryan todd good thanks maybe one capital allocation think capital budget year next years range within budgets think range primarily driven timing possibility higher commodity prices think maybe pushing towards higher end range combination inflation opportunities

inflation darren woods yeah would add salary action announced morning taking wont material analysis youre paul intention would continue deliver efficiencies projected plan paul cheng right thank operator next well go manav gupta credit suisse manav gupta quick question start call indicated asian chemical margins mid cycle want understand generally crude moves support commodity prices theres two equations going capacity coming crude also moving expect margins remain mid cycle time think higher crude could actually push ethylene margins stuff nonus region goforward basis thank darren woods sure yeah think unusual time weve got chemicals market see level dislocation whats happening asia see happening atlantic basin think made reference comments north america footprint chemical ethane advantage actually helped mitigate broader downturn seeing global chemical markets heavily weighted weighted towards downturn seeing asia think look crude prices coming marginal supply olefins liquids cracker naphtha feed crude price goes feed goes naphtha feed goes youve got cost increases feed logistics constraints ability connect markets demand somewhat dislocated youve got oversupply market like china see demand coming lockdowns logistics constraints think unique period right youre seeing regional imbalances inability close imbalances logistics transportation difficult say long going last think ultimately markets open well see equilibrate think crude remains high suspicion ethane ethane cracking continue advantaged obviously move crude prices move respect gas prices manav gupta
