Uber Technologies, Inc.
Q4 2023 Prepared Remarks
February 7, 2024

Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO
Q4 was a standout quarter to cap off a standout year. Consumer activity remained healthy across
the world, supported by the continued shift of spending from retail to services. Our consumer
base is now bigger and more engaged than ever: audience (MAPCs) and frequency (monthly trips
per MAPC) both hit new all-time highs. And for the second consecutive quarter, Gross Bookings
accelerated year-over-year (YoY), to 21% on a constant currency basis. Notably, trip growth of 24%
once again outpaced Gross Bookings growth. These strong top-line trends, combined with
continued rigor on costs, translated to $1.3 billion in Adjusted EBITDA and $652 million in GAAP
operating income.
2023 was a year of sustainable, profitable growth for Uber as we executed against our strategy.
We grew our business by improving marketplace health and scaling new products, bolstering our
competitive position in key markets. Powering this growth are the 6.8 million monthly drivers and
couriers who earned nearly $62 billion on our platform during the year, up 24% YoY on a constant
currency basis. We also made important progress on key areas of strategic focus, including
membership, electrification, safety, public policy, and autonomous partnerships. And we further
extended our technical advantages by sharing innovations across our multiple business lines,
driving differentiated results.
Turning to 2024, I want to highlight several key priorities. First, our goal is to make the Uber use
case even more of an everyday reality. We’ll continue to enhance the power of our platform by
expanding the number of consumers who use multiple Uber products, turbocharged by our Uber
One membership program. Second, we will strategically reinvest into promising new growth
vectors to deliver strong multi-year growth with healthy long-term unit economics. Lastly, we will
maintain our industry-leading cost structure and use our data advantage to drive more efficient
pricing, matching, and incentive spend.
Our strategy is working, and we are proving ourselves to be the category-defining platform, as
well as thoughtful partners to stakeholders globally. I’m energized by the pace of innovation and
the momentum I’m seeing across the company. We will continue to capitalize on the large,
valuable opportunities ahead of us. We remain well positioned to sustainably generate leading
shareholder value over the long-term.
Mobility
The demand environment remained robust during our busiest quarter of the year, as we posted
Mobility Gross Bookings growth of 28% YoY on a constant-currency basis. Notably, Latin America
1

and Asia Pacific saw outsized trip growth on strong holiday travel trends and growth in our
non-UberX portfolio. Growth was consistent across all use cases, leading to a steady increase in
both Mobility MAPCs and monthly trips per MAPC as pricing trends continued to normalize.
We made strong progress in broadening Mobility use cases and price segmentation. Our suite of
non-UberX products like Reserve, Taxi, Moto, Uber for Business, and Shared Rides continued to
grow more than 80% YoY in Q4, generating $11 billion in annualized bookings (or 14% of Mobility
Gross Bookings). In Q4, Shared Rides became the fourth non-UberX product to cross $1 billion in
annualized bookings as we expanded the service to 11 new markets. While Shared Rides margins
are lower than UberX margins, we have seen meaningful improvements in match rates and rider
opt-in – both of which are key components to building Shared Rides into a scaled, sustainable,
ROI positive product. We continued to bring more taxis onto the platform, announcing that
London’s iconic Black Cabs will be available on Uber later this year. We are also seeing strong
adoption of premium products in our business travel segment, with over 40% of corporate travel
activity on Uber happening on products like Business Comfort, Uber Black, and Reserve.
Supply trends continue to improve, with active drivers up 30% YoY and driver engagement
(defined as monthly supply hours per active driver) up 10% YoY. At our Only on Uber driver event,
we announced more than 20 improvements to the Uber Driver app, while also taking steps to
make earning on Uber both safer (with features like Record my Ride) and fairer (with
improvements to our account deactivation process). Our focus on product innovation and quality,
as well as the breadth of ways to earn on Uber, continues to separate us from our competitors on
driver preference. We will continue to grow supply both through our traditional base and through
new pools of supply, like taxis and fleets.
Delivery
Delivery Gross Bookings growth accelerated for the third quarter in a row, up 17% YoY on a
constant-currency basis, while Adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled YoY and reached a record
margin. In fact, Delivery Gross Bookings growth was the highest in two years, driven by focused
investments in product experience and increased membership penetration. Encouragingly, an
increasing percentage of our Delivery Gross Bookings growth is coming from trip and audience
growth this year versus pricing last year.
Our US & Canada business displayed broad-based operational improvements, with accelerating
Gross Bookings YoY growth and record profitability. We’ve seen tremendous momentum in
membership, which now represents nearly 50% of US Delivery Gross Bookings (up 10 percentage
points YoY) with strong retention levels. Outside of the US, we continue to be encouraged by the
progress we have made to broaden our leading competitive position across our top international
markets. In addition, we jointly launched with Domino’s in Taiwan and announced pilots in the UK
and Ireland, after scaling across the US.

In 2023, we significantly expanded Delivery margins through improved network efficiencies,
advertising, and marketing and incentive optimization. We also launched over 100 initiatives to
root out a host of customer experience problems that can arise during deliveries. We continue to
be laser focused on these fundamental operational improvements, which contribute to higher
consumer satisfaction as well as margin expansion.
Even as we expand Delivery margins, we are strategically investing in Grocery & Retail (formerly
referred to as New Verticals) which also includes categories such as convenience and alcohol.
Grocery & Retail generated $7 billion of annualized Gross Bookings in Q4 (or 10% of Delivery
Gross Bookings), growing roughly 40% YoY on a constant-currency basis. For perspective,
Grocery & Retail Gross Bookings accounted for 20% of Delivery’s overall YoY growth. We
completed the integration of Cornershop and launched several new features that drove a clear
impact on key consumer metrics like new user acquisition and frequency. We also continued to
make progress on Grocery & Retail selection in the US, bringing merchants like Big Lots, Sprouts
Farmers Market, and Eataly onto the platform.
Freight
Freight Gross Bookings were stable sequentially and remained pressured by near-term
category-wide headwinds, as capacity in the trucking sector continues to normalize. In Q4, we
started to onboard several new enterprise customers, including food and beverage-industry
leader Danone North America, to the Transportation Management business, driven in part by
enhanced Uber Freight Transportation Management System (TMS) capabilities. We also launched
our new Emissions Dashboard to provide shippers with comprehensive insights into their
network’s emissions across all modes. We remain disciplined in cost management, with Adjusted
EBITDA stable sequentially. We are seeing some glimmers of light in terms of spot freight rates,
but it’s far too soon to assume the glimmer will turn into a trend.
Platform initiatives
Our Uber One member base continued its impressive growth, now at 19 million members across
25 countries. We believe Uber One is the best membership offer in the space, with the best
“content” – or the most ways to save – as evidenced by our steady progress on adoption, with
members generating 30% of Mobility and Delivery Gross Bookings (up 700 bps YoY). In addition
to geographic expansion, we’re driving new member growth through brand campaigns and user
experience improvements, such as rolling out a prompt to convert non-members to members
during the Delivery checkout process. In the UK, our member base grew over 50% QoQ as
consumers responded positively to our brand campaign with Robert De Niro and Asa Butterfield.
We’ve also seen meaningful increases in member retention and engagement by reducing
payment failures and cancellations, expanding Member Quests, and more than doubling our
Annual Plan adoption through initiatives like our Black Friday campaign in the US.

Our advertising business continues to scale profitably, reaching a $900 million revenue run-rate
for Q4. We expanded Sponsored Items on Uber Eats to the alcohol category and to new markets
across Latin America. We also launched 150+ product features and experiments in 2023 across
our Mobility and Delivery surfaces, including Post-Checkout display and video, Sponsored
Search, and Journey video. Further, we continued our direct sales global expansion with the
addition of Japan, Taiwan, and Spain. As we look ahead, we are focused on growing demand
with businesses and merchants of all sizes, both on and off our platform, by improving our
ranking and bidding algorithms and strengthening our ad tech capabilities across video,
targeting, insights, measurement, and attribution.
Autonomous vehicles
We have 10 autonomous partnerships across Mobility, Delivery, and Freight, highlighting the value
Uber can bring to autonomous providers. As of Q4, riders have taken tens of thousands of
autonomous, fully electric rides on Uber and we are achieving high rider ratings via our hybrid
marketplace, which matches the right riders to the right autonomous vehicle trips. Our hybrid
network enables incremental autonomous commercialization while preserving reliability and
convenience. As such, our autonomous partners have seen high rates of utilization on Uber. We
remain confident in our ability to best aggregate autonomous demand. Our scale means we can
bring a massive consumer base, industry-leading matching and routing technology, in addition to
relationships with hundreds of thousands of merchants; in turn, that means our AV partners can
ensure their vehicles are highly utilized, resulting in better economics for them, while delivering
an excellent experience to consumers. We are well positioned to add substantial value for our AV
partners and the cities we serve.

Financial recap
Both Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA surpassed the high end of our Q4 outlook. Gross
Bookings growth accelerated to 21% YoY on a constant-currency basis (23% excluding Freight), as
we generated Gross Bookings of $37.6 billion. Foreign exchange was a tailwind of roughly $500
million YoY (or roughly 160 bps). We grew our revenue by 13% YoY on a constant-currency basis to
$9.9 billion. As a reminder, certain business model changes, which have no real economic impact
to profitability, negatively impacted revenue reporting by $529 million and combined Mobility and
Delivery YoY revenue growth by approximately 7 percentage points.
We maintained our focus on operational efficiency and disciplined expense management, which
contributed to all-time high Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (note: foreign exchange was a $30
million YoY tailwind). This result represents a record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.4% of Gross
Bookings, an increase of 130 bps YoY.

In Q4, we also improved our GAAP operating profitability, with income from operations of $652
million, compared to $394 million and a loss of $142 million in Q3 2023 and Q4 2022,
respectively. Income from operations improved QoQ due to improved operating performance and
lower stock-based compensation expense. We demonstrated strong operating leverage in Q4,
with GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of Gross Bookings declining on a YoY basis
across the board. Net headcount was down roughly 5% QoQ from Q3, driven by role eliminations
as part of M&A integrations. For the full year 2023, net headcount was down 7% YoY. We expect
to demonstrate further operating leverage over the coming quarters through headcount
discipline.
Balance sheet and liquidity
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, ending the quarter with $5.4 billion in
unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, with our equity stakes marked at
$6.1 billion. During Q4, we recognized a $1.0 billion unrealized pre-tax gain related to the
revaluation of our equity investments. Our GAAP net income may continue to see swings from
quarter-to-quarter due to the large size of equity stakes on our balance sheet. We continue to
have sufficient liquidity to give us the flexibility to maintain these positions, with the aim of
maximizing long-term value for Uber and our shareholders.
Free cash flow (FCF) and capital allocation
We generated $768 million of FCF in Q4, an increase of $1.1 billion YoY, compared to Adjusted
EBITDA of $1.3 billion. Note that Q4 FCF includes cash outflows related to a number of discrete
legal and tax matters we disclosed in our Q3 2023 earnings release. As a reminder, FCF
conversion on a quarterly basis can fluctuate due to working capital seasonality and the timing of
cash payments, among other factors, and we encourage investors to evaluate our FCF on an
annual basis. On a trailing twelve month basis, we generated $3.4 billion of FCF, compared to
Adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 billion. Overall, we are pleased with our underlying FCF generation,
demonstrating the significant earnings power of the business.
We remain on a very clear path to an investment grade credit rating, which continues to be an
important part of our overall capital structure focus. This commitment should provide investors
comfort that we will continue to methodically ramp FCF over the coming years, while being
disciplined on capital allocation and managing our capital structure. This means that we will have
a high bar for any M&A opportunities, and our organic growth efforts will keep a critical eye on
healthy unit economics as we continue to scale globally.
We are pleased with the progress we have made on improving profitability and generating cash
flow. We plan to provide an update on returning capital to shareholders as part of a broader
capital allocation framework at our Investor Update next week.

Outlook
Based on quarter-to-date trends, for Q1:
●

●

We expect Gross Bookings between $37.0 billion and $38.5 billion, growing 18% to 23%
on a constant-currency basis.
○ Our outlook assumes a roughly 1 percentage point currency headwind to reported
YoY growth.
○ We expect Freight Gross Bookings to be roughly flat QoQ.
We expect Adjusted EBITDA of $1.26 billion to $1.34 billion.

In 2023, we achieved an important profitability milestone of quarterly and full-year positive GAAP
operating income. Adjusted EBITDA remains our primary profitability metric, but we recognize it
excludes certain expenses like stock-based compensation, which is a real and important cost to
operating our business. Looking ahead, we are focused on improving the scale and quality of our
profitability and look forward to accelerating our momentum over the coming quarters.
