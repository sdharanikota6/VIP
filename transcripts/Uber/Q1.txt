Uber Technologies, Inc.
Q1 2023 Prepared Remarks
May 2, 2023

Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO
Uber is off to a strong start in 2023, with constant-currency Gross Bookings up 22% year-on-year
(YoY). Trips outpaced Gross Bookings growth, growing 24% YoY (compared to our outlook for
20%+ growth), with MAPCs up 13% YoY and Trips per MAPC up 10% YoY. Our clear lead on driver
preference has allowed us to better serve this growing demand: 5.7 million drivers and couriers
earned $13.7 billion (including tips) on Uber during the quarter, both all-time highs. The
combination of these strong topline trends and continued cost rigor translated to Adjusted
EBITDA of $761 million and record free cash flow of $549 million.
Our robust outlook for Q2 extends our track record of delivering strong growth and profitability.
As the operating environment adjusts to a period of tighter capital availability and higher interest
rates, we are well positioned to improve our competitive position across our key markets.
Our strategy remains to build best-in-class verticals across Mobility and Delivery and to amplify
that leadership position through the power of our platform. We’re extending our common
technical foundations by sharing marketplace innovations across all of our products, driving both
cost efficiencies and more reliable marketplaces. In addition, our global scale affords us a
significant data advantage compared to regional competitors, empowering us to develop
cutting-edge AI that can be trained across larger data sets. For example, on the consumer side,
we are using an ultra-low latency deep neural network to predict highly accurate ETAs for rides
and deliveries. On the earner side, we have developed advanced computer vision algorithms that
have allowed us to more reliably and cost-efficiently process documents, resulting in faster
onboarding times. We are still in the early stages of using large data models to power improved
user experiences and efficiencies across our platform, with much more to come.
We are also leveraging our platform to incubate and scale promising new growth vectors like
hailables, Uber for Business, grocery, advertising, and Uber Direct. We will continue to take a
disciplined approach to funding these efforts and will hold ourselves to high standards of both
growth and profitability. Net headcount was down modestly QoQ, and after our performance
management actions in Q1, we now expect to hold headcount flat to down through the coming
quarters. More deliberate performance management of both our employees and our businesses
has allowed us to redeploy resources towards high-priority projects without adding net
headcount. We expect this focus on headcount efficiency to be ongoing as we look to deliver
further leverage against our fixed-cost base beyond 2023.

Mobility
We delivered strong Mobility Gross Bookings growth and a record Adjusted EBITDA margin,
driven by improving marketplace health and increasing consumer engagement. Mobility trips
grew 32% YoY in Q1, accelerating from 24% YoY in Q4, as consumer engagement reached a
post-pandemic high and we lapped Omicron impacts. The US, Canada, and Latin America all
delivered Gross Bookings and Trips growth above typical seasonal trends, and, notably, Brazil
reached an all-time high of 7.7 trips per MAPC in March. Even more encouragingly, after lagging
other regions in the recovery through 2021 and 2022, the rideshare category in the US & Canada
is now growing faster in 2023. US & Canada trips grew 40% YoY in Q1, outpacing overall Mobility
trends, as improving marketplace balance is driving lower fares (7% lower from a peak in Q2
2022) and better conversion of shopping sessions.
By rolling out innovative new Mobility products, we have not only attracted new drivers and riders
to the platform, but they are engaging with us more often. Consequently, we are seeing
constructive category position trends across most of our major markets with expanding
profitability, even as our competitors continue to compete on incentives and price. In the US &
Canada, we continue to hold a strong category position with record profit margins, even as we
reduced our combined driver and rider incentives per trip in the US & Canada by 42% YoY and
12% QoQ in Q1.
In Q1, Mobility active drivers were up 35% YoY, reflecting an increase of over 1 million active
drivers. Driver engagement (or monthly supply hours per active driver) in the US & Canada was
up over 15% compared to 2019 levels and nearly 10% YoY (see Q1 2023 supplemental data), while
driver churn was down substantially. Combined with higher engagement, weekly earnings for
active drivers in the US & Canada were up over 40% vs. 2019. Internationally, we recently
reached all-time highs for monthly active drivers in the UK, France, Brazil, Australia, and India,
among others. These strong trends would not be possible without our early prioritization of
supply growth coming out of the pandemic, which has been sustained and reinforced by our
driver-focused approach, including through product and technical innovations in the Uber Driver
app.
Our lead on driver preference is resulting in a better rider experience and strong consumer
engagement trends. In fact, consumers in the US & Canada who started using Uber after the
pandemic are engaging with the platform more frequently and spending significantly more than
those who started before the pandemic (see Q1 2023 supplemental data). These trends are not
limited to North America, and our international business continues to reach new heights on driver
and consumer engagement as well.
These consumer engagement gains are also being driven by our growing portfolio of new
Mobility products beyond UberX, which together continued to grow over 100% YoY in Q1,
exceeding $6 billion in annualized Gross Bookings. Notably, we expanded Uber Reserve to

additional markets in EMEA, with the product now available in over 50 countries. Uber Reserve
continues to show strong product market fit, particularly with Airport trips, with over 20% of our
Airport drop-off Gross Bookings now booked through Reserve. We also continued executing
towards our goal of getting every taxi on Uber by 2025, launching our taxi product in Munich and
São Paulo and expanding to 100% of taxis in New York City. Finally, we made progress towards
scaling our new shared rides product, UberX Share, which is designed to operate with positive
unit economics for Uber, while offering a lower-cost alternative to consumers. We expect UberX
Share to become our newest billion-dollar Gross Bookings product in the coming quarters.
With our global scale and deeper local density, we are increasingly separating from smaller
regional competitors both on driver preference and on the breadth of Mobility products we offer
consumers.
Delivery
Delivery continued to grow at a healthy rate, with improving category position in a significant
majority of our large markets alongside meaningfully expanded profitability. Delivery Gross
Bookings grew 12% YoY on a constant-currency basis, with acceleration in February and March,
exiting the quarter at 14% YoY. Delivery trips, MAPCs, and order frequency all remained at or near
all-time highs in the quarter.
Delivery margins expanded to nearly 2% of Gross Bookings as a result of improved network
efficiencies, the increased contribution of advertising, and continued marketing and incentive
optimization. In 2022, we steadily benefited from tech and operational improvements that drove
meaningful cost per trip improvements in the US & Canada. We are now rolling out these
improvements to other markets.
Last year, we also kicked off a workstream to significantly reduce order defects on our platform.
Refunds and appeasement (R&A) costs are one of the largest components of Delivery’s operating
costs, and a defective order can cost even more over the long run if it results in consumer churn.
To put these costs in perspective, for every 10 basis points of defect-rate improvement, we save
over $15 million of R&A spend annually. The true savings are larger once we factor in the
opportunity cost of lost engagement and the incentive spend needed to retain an unhappy
consumer. We are seeing positive early signals and have ambitious goals for this initiative.
As we look ahead, we will continue to make operational and category position improvements in
restaurant delivery. The US & Canada business has performed particularly well. Our selection has
improved significantly in recent quarters, especially with SMBs, with active merchants in the US &
Canada up 10% YoY in Q1. We’ve also leaned into Uber One to help lower the total cost to
consumers, and Uber One adoption in the US & Canada reached an all-time high in the quarter.

Outside of the US & Canada, we are seeing constructive category position trends across key
markets in EMEA and APAC (including the UK, Australia, and Japan), driven by Uber One
adoption, as well as a relative investment advantage against regional competitors due to our
global scale. In particular, we had another standout quarter in the UK, gaining multiple points of
category position YoY. In Japan, we have gained over 10 points of category position YoY, and are
continuing to increase our lead against competitors in a market that is one of the largest Delivery
markets globally.
Even as we expand Delivery profitability, we are strategically investing in New Verticals like
grocery, convenience, and alcohol, which we believe will be profitable and strengthen the value
of our platform over time. New Verticals exceeded $5 billion of annualized Gross Bookings in Q1,
growing nearly 35% YoY on a constant-currency basis. These new categories also open up new
earnings opportunities for couriers, especially as we improve our shopping experience by
addressing commonly raised issues, like out-of-stock items and substitutions. We continue to
make strong progress on New Verticals selection, including last month’s partnership with Coles,
Australia’s second-largest grocer, in which couriers will pick and pack groceries. We have also
added partners like the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) in Canada, PetSmart in the US,
and Mexican pharmacy Benavides.
Freight
Uber Freight continued to be pressured by category-wide headwinds. Freight demand was
muted even when taking into account seasonal factors, which drove a top- and bottom-line miss
against our expectations. Despite the challenging macro market, the Freight business continues
to expand its solutions to better support shippers throughout the entire freight lifecycle, as well
as offer steady and reliable partnership to shippers who are increasingly turning to managed
services to help navigate ongoing market complexity.
We remain proactive in our approach to managing the business and are taking advantage of a
slower market to accelerate streamlining areas of the business and to implement structural cost
improvements. Looking past the near-term headwinds, we are confident that Freight’s
technology, shipper platform, and marketplace flywheel will drive a long-term cost advantage and
profitable growth over time.
Advertising
Our Advertising business continues to scale, as our advertiser base grew over 70% YoY to more
than 345,000 businesses of all sizes. In Q1, we saw many new advertisers come to Uber during
one of the biggest advertising moments of the year: the Super Bowl. To attract additional
advertisers, we continue to invest in new products and advertiser tools like Post-Checkout Ads
on Uber Eats, which enable non-restaurant merchants to advertise in the Eats app. Further, we

launched a self-service platform for Cartop Ads, which gives drivers a way to earn more revenue
and spotlight local businesses.
We’ll have more product updates to share at our annual GO-GET showcase on Wednesday, May
17 in New York, where we’ll focus on family, friends, and travel. And later this summer we’ll host
GO-GET Zero, our first sustainability and electrification product event, in London.

Nelson Chai, CFO
Financial recap
We delivered strong results in Q1, with Gross Bookings growing 22% YoY on a constant-currency
basis to $31.4 billion, near the midpoint of our guidance range. Foreign exchange was a
headwind of roughly $855 million YoY (or roughly 320 bps), in line with our expectations. At a
segment level, Mobility Gross Bookings reached another all-time high, driven by growing
consumer engagement across use cases, while Delivery Gross Bookings grew 12% YoY on a
constant-currency basis. Freight Gross Bookings decreased sequentially, and missed our
expectations, largely due to continued macroeconomic headwinds impacting the brokerage
industry. Excluding Freight, we generated Gross Bookings growth of 25% YoY on a
constant-currency basis.
Adjusted EBITDA of $761 million was significantly better than our guidance range, with strong
results across Mobility and Delivery (note: foreign exchange was a $46 million YoY headwind).
This result represents an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.4% of Gross Bookings and an incremental
margin of 12% YoY. We continued to deliver Adjusted EBITDA outperformance, driven by
disciplined cost management across the board. During the quarter, we took action to reduce
headcount in underperforming areas, and actively managed performance in R&D and the rest of
the company. As a result, we expect to demonstrate further operating leverage over the coming
quarters.
Mobility Adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion, reaching another record-high margin of 7.1% of Gross
Bookings. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA significantly improved both sequentially and YoY to $288
million, with a margin of 1.9% of Gross Bookings. Freight Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $23
million.
On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss from operations of $262 million, compared to losses of
$142 million and $482 million in Q4 2022 and Q1 2022, respectively. GAAP operating losses
expanded QoQ due to higher legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements,
partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense and lower stock-based
compensation (SBC) expense.

Balance sheet and liquidity
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, ending the quarter with $4.2 billion in
unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, with our equity stakes marked at
$5.4 billion. During Q1, we recognized a $320 million unrealized pre-tax gain related to the
revaluation of our equity investments. Our GAAP net income may continue to see swings from
quarter-to-quarter due to the large size of equity stakes on our balance sheet. We continue to
have sufficient liquidity to give us the flexibility to maintain these positions, with the aim of
maximizing long term value for Uber and our shareholders. Notably, we completed the sale of our
remaining equity interest in MLU B.V., our joint venture with Yandex, to Yandex for $702.5 million
in April 2023.
In Q1, we refinanced all of Uber’s term loans, extending the full $2.5 billion to a 2030 maturity,
while lowering the financing spread by 75 bps.
Free cash flow (FCF) and capital allocation
We generated $549 million of FCF in Q1, an increase of $596 million YoY, compared to Adjusted
EBITDA of $761 million.
As we have previously discussed, we are focused on achieving investment-grade credit ratings
over the coming years. During Q1, our credit rating was upgraded by both S&P and Moody’s, and
our credit remains on a positive outlook at both agencies. Our commitment to achieving
investment-grade credit ratings should provide investors comfort that we will methodically
continue to scale profitability through the coming years, while being disciplined on capital
allocation and managing our capital structure. This means that we will have a high bar for any
M&A opportunities, and our organic growth efforts will have a critical focus on unit economics as
we continue to scale globally.
Over the next few quarters, we will evaluate returning excess capital to shareholders as our cash
flows ramp, and with any potential further monetization of our equity stakes over the long term.
We believe that our approach will position us to have the lowest cost of capital relative to our
competitors, serving as a significant competitive advantage and allowing us to continue to grow
our scale and platform advantages over the long run.

Outlook
Based on quarter-to-date trends, for Q2:
●

●

We expect Gross Bookings between $33 billion and $34 billion, growing 18% to 22%
excluding Freight and on a constant-currency basis. Including Freight, we expect Gross
Bookings growth of 15% to 19% on a constant-currency basis.
○ We expect trips to grow at least 20% YoY.
○ Our outlook assumes a roughly 2 percentage point currency YoY headwind in Q2.
○ In addition, we expect Freight Gross Bookings to be roughly flat QoQ.
We expect Adjusted EBITDA of $800 million to $850 million.

As we approach GAAP profitability, we are providing some additional visibility into our GAAP P&L:
●

●

●

Q2: We expect a significant improvement in GAAP operating income in Q2 with lower
legal, tax, and regulatory costs more than offsetting a modest sequential increase in SBC
(reflecting a full quarter of our March 2023 RSU grants).
D&A: In Q1, our D&A consisted of $91 million in depreciation and $116 million in
amortization costs (with total D&A down 19% YoY). We expect D&A to continue to decline
over the coming quarters, driven by real estate and data center footprint management,
and with the run-off of prior years’ acquisition-related amortization costs.
SBC: We expect annual SBC to be less than $2 billion in 2023 and to decline YoY in
2024, with headcount flat to down in 2023 and relatively flat in 2024.

We remain focused on delivering quarterly GAAP operating income profitability in 2023, and we
expect to scale GAAP profitability significantly beyond 2023.

Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO
Over the last two years, we have consistently delivered results that have exceeded both investor
expectations and our own internal plans. Even as we have performed well, we are acutely aware
that expectations have only continued to increase for scaled platforms like ours.
We are working to accelerate our path to GAAP net income by optimizing every single line item
across our entire P&L—including stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization, and
interest expenses.
Put simply, we remain committed to best-of-breed cash flow growth, irrespective of the demand
environment. The Uber platform has never been stronger, our own expectations have never been
higher, and we intend to leave no doubt as to the scope of our ambitions for exceptionally
profitable growth.
