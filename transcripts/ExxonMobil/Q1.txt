               ExxonMobil First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call Transcript
    This transcript presents ExxonMobil’s first quarter 2023 earnings call held on April 28, 2023.



Operator:        Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation first-quarter 2023

        earnings call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice

        President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.



Jennifer Driscoll: Good morning. Welcome to ExxonMobil's first-quarter 2023 earnings call. Thanks for

        joining us today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me are Darren

        Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President, and Chief

        Financial Officer. Our presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the new Investor

        Relations section of our website. They're meant to accompany the first-quarter earnings news

        release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will provide opening comments and

        reference a few slides from this presentation. That will give analysts more time to ask questions

        before we conclude at 8.30 A.M. Central Time.



        During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, which are subject to risks and

        uncertainties. We describe some of them in our cautionary statement here on slide two. Additional

        information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements are listed in

        our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs available on our website for investors. Also, please note that

        we provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the

        website. And now please turn to slide three for Darren's remarks.



Darren Woods: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Following a record year, ExxonMobil delivered

        the highest first-quarter earnings in our history even as energy prices and refining margins

        moderated from the fourth quarter. This ongoing success reflects the hard work of our people,

        executing our strategic priorities and fully leveraging our competitive advantages.           Through

        investments in advantaged assets, mix improvements, and cost and operating discipline, we are

        delivering the structural earnings improvements outlined in our corporate plan update last December

        and expanding the energy supplies needed to meet growing global demand.



        Compared to the first quarter of 2022, we added about 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to

        global supply, primarily from a 40% increase in production from Guyana and the Permian Basin. The

        increase more than offset our divestments and the expropriation of Sakhalin-1, which we no longer

        account for, but which, importantly, remains part of global supply. In addition, our Beaumont

        refinery expansion reached nameplate capacity in the quarter. This 250,000 barrel a day expansion is

        the largest US refinery addition in a decade, helping meet society's ongoing need for transportation

        fuels. In Guyana, we're pleased to announce that we reached final investment decisions for Uaru, the

        fifth offshore project, which will bring on even more production from this low-cost, low-carbon

        intensity resource. Uaru will provide an additional 250,000 barrels a day of gross capacity with start-

        up targeted for 2026.



        Earnings in our Product Solutions business benefited from the team's solid operational execution

        with top-quartile turnaround cost and schedule performance during a particularly heavy planned

        maintenance period.



        In Low Carbon Solutions, we're building momentum across several fronts.             In early April, we

        announced a long-term agreement with Linde to capture, transport, and permanently store up to 2.2

        million metric tons CO2 annually. In hydrogen, we announced front-end engineering and design

        contract for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen facility in Baytown, and a heads of agreement

        with SK Group of Korea for offtake of blue ammonia from that facility. As we said during our Low

        Carbon Solutions spotlight earlier this month, our low carbon projects must be advantaged and




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                2
        deliver competitive returns. The ability of our low-carbon projects to compete successfully for capital

        is important if the world is going to meet its emissions aspirations.



        Incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act are a positive step forward, although permitting

        and other regulatory improvements are still needed. In Europe, by contrast, policy approach remains

        far more prescriptive and punitive. This is true whether we're talking about the emissions reductions

        needed to put the world on a path to net-zero or the production needed to provide Europe with

        affordable and reliable energy. The progress we're making across the company is underpinned by

        the continuing evolution of our business model. Effective on May 1st, two new enterprise-wide

        organizations will be up and running.



        Global Business Solutions will centralize the majority of our finance and procurement operations,

        enabling us to deliver simplified corporate-wide processes.             ExxonMobil Supply Chain will

        consolidate supply chain activities globally. The organizations will focus on leveraging our scale to

        drive efficiencies, improve operating and financial results, and, importantly, deliver an improved

        experience for customers, vendors, and our people. On June 1st, we plan to launch our new

        enterprise-wide trading organization. Global Trading will bring together expertise from across the

        company in crude, products, natural gas, power, and marine freight trading. We plan to build on our

        record 2022 results, leveraging the unique insights we gain from participating across each of our

        value chains and all along their entire length with a global operating footprint larger than any of our

        competitors.



        Now, let me cover the quarter's headlines. We're pleased to have delivered $11.4 billion of earnings,

        a record first-quarter following a record year. A significant contributing factor was structural cost

        savings that now total approximately $7.2 billion and keeps us on track to meet our target of $9

        billion by the end of this year. Cash flow from operations totaled $16.3 billion, and our net debt-to-




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                3
        capital ratio declined to 4%, further increasing the strength of our balance sheet while supporting

        shareholder distributions of $8.1 billion in the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends. Despite a

        dynamic market, our underlying performance remains rock-solid and well ahead of our competition,

        reflecting the many improvements we've made over the last six years and of course, the hard work of

        our people.



        Our diverse portfolio of advantaged businesses, improvements in mix, structural cost savings, and

        excellence in execution are driving industry-leading earnings, cash flow, and shareholder value.

        Combined with the strength of our balance sheet, we have the capability to win across a wide variety

        of market conditions to deliver strong returns while meeting the evolving needs of society, including

        the need to reduce emissions.        Leveraging the capabilities and advantages developed in our

        traditional businesses, we're building an advantaged new business - Low Carbon Solutions - which is

        positioning us as a leader in the energy transition, reducing our own and other's emissions, and

        establishing long-term value-accretive growth opportunities that will underpin continued growth in

        shareholder returns. With that, let me turn the call over to Jennifer.



Jennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Darren. Now let's move to Q&A. As a courtesy to other analysts, please limit

        yourself to a single question. That way we can accommodate more questions from more people.

        Also, please remain on the line in case we need to ask any clarifying questions. With that, operator,

        please open up the line for our first question.



Operator:        Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically.

        If you'd like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your

        touchtone telephone. We'll go first to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                 4
Neil Mehta:      Thank you so much. Darren, you’ve spent a lot of time in the refining business over the

        years, and you've had a perspective on these calls that margins were going to start to normalize, and

        we're seeing some indication of that. I'd just be curious on your views on what you're seeing in terms

        of product demand? And then, how do you think it's going to manifest itself in - through the refining

        system from a margin perspective over the next couple of years? Thank you.



Darren Woods: Yes. Good morning, Neil. A couple of points, I think as we're looking at the refining margin.

        Obviously, the first I would make is we don't really pride ourselves on being able to forecast margins.

        So, I’ll caveat everything I say with the recognition that given the impact that demand has on the

        margins, given the fairly static supply side of the equation, it's often difficult to know exactly where

        things are going to go. What I would say is, as you look at where we're at today, this is seasonally a

        low point as you head into second-quarter and third-quarter and driving season when you tend to

        see supply and demand tighten up and margins improve. You typically see early in the year a lot of

        refining turnarounds, which take a lot of capacity off-line in that lower demand season.



        And then when those turnarounds are finished and capacity comes back out, you get a surge of

        supply. And so, you generally see refining margins drop off here in kind of this valley between the

        supply coming back and then demand picking up as you head into early summer and on to the year.

        So, I think that's important context in terms of what we're seeing right now. Gasoline demand looks

        pretty reasonable, frankly. I think jet demand and transportation looks like it's kind of trending up

        and certainly from listening to some of our customers in that space, expectations of a fairly healthy

        air transportation or airline travel miles going forward in the summer.



        So, I think in my view is we're going to see the typical push up in the summer and see margins rise.

        Longer term it comes back to what happens in China. It has been a source of not only demand but

        also of exports. Their exports have been higher in the first quarter, but it depends on how those play




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                 5
        out going forward. If we see similar levels of exports as we saw last year, my expectation is that will

        put additional upward pressure on the margin. So, I think that's kind of the things to watch.



        The last point I'd make on refining margins, which I think is somewhat structural, typically the

        marginal barrel in refining comes out of Europe. And so, Europe is the price setter for global markets

        ex-transportation. We've got high gas prices in Europe with, I think, the potential to go higher.

        You've got high carbon prices in Europe. And so that marginal tier of production is a lot more

        expensive than it's been historically. And that's going to keep, I think, pressure on higher prices for

        the globe and therefore better margins if you're producing outside of Europe.



Neil Mehta:      Okay, Darren. Thanks so much.



Darren Woods: You bet.



Operator:        We’ll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.



Doug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Darren, I wonder if I could kick off first on disposals,

        another reasonable contribution from non-core asset sales. Can you characterize where you are in

        that process and what you think you might have still in front of you in terms of non-core asset sales?

        And I've got a quick follow-up, please.



Darren Woods: Sure, Doug. Good morning. Well, I think if you look at the plans we set ourselves, I think,

        back in 2018 where we talked about, particularly in the Upstream, increasing our divestments and

        taking a very thoughtful approach there, making sure that we were positioning ourselves that when

        the market was right and we had interest from buyers that we had assets ready to sell and divest, has




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                6
        worked fairly well. We've been, I think, pretty successful at consistently putting assets in the market

        and realizing the value of those.



        We should hit the objective that we set back in 2018 probably sometime this year. And then as we

        continue to work on high grading the portfolio, continue to look at assets that we don't see are

        strategic necessarily, or where we see higher value for others, we'll continue to feed that divestment

        portfolio and market those assets. So, my expectation is we've got an inventory of things going

        forward and would expect to see, in my mind, kind of consistent rate of being out in the market and

        basically seeing if we can find buyers who have a higher use for the assets than we do, and therefore

        better value, and therefore decent base.



        I'd just make the final point that, as we look at the divestments, it is a value proposition. We are

        comfortable with everything we've got in the portfolio. It's really a question of how we optimize and

        maximize the value, and that's been the focus from the very beginning, and continues to be one. So,

        we don't have to sell anything. It's only if we find a valuable opportunity to do that.



Doug Leggate: I appreciate the answer. I couldn't remember if Jennifer said one question or one plus one

        follow-up. So, I'll risk a follow-up very quickly. I'll delicately ask this question if I may. Obviously,

        Kathy was on the wires this morning talking about how picky Exxon would be on M&A. I just want to

        ask you if you feel that you need to backfill your Permian position at any time in the future? And I'll

        leave you there. Thank you.



Darren Woods: Yes. Okay, Doug, I'll give you this one plus one. Look, it amazes me the amount of questions

        that come up in this space, I think we've been pretty consistent as we've talked about it. We're

        always looking for an opportunity for an acquisition and one that grows value. And it's got to be

        value accretive. It's got to be one where what Exxon Mobil brings to the table actually increases




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                  7
         what either company would do independent of one another. And so that's kind of, I'd say, the

         underlying approach.



         While we're in a depletion business, and we've got to work really hard to continue to bring volume

         on, we're not actually in the market to find volume. We're in the market to find value. And we're

         willing to kind of let volumes do what they will do in the search for making sure that anything that we

         bring into the portfolio is accretive and is a unique value contribution for the shareholders. And so, I

         mean, we're working really hard on our technology portfolio in the Permian. I've talked about that in

         the past. My view is success in technology and developing proprietary technology, which improves

         either resource recovery or the cost of developing that resource, whatever that is, whatever value

         lever our technology can bring to the table, that obviously opens up deal space. And to the extent

         that we are very active in the Permian, we've got a really good anchor business there, and we're

         working really hard on opening up the value proposition of our current acreage with technology, that

         will open up, potentially, opportunities for acquisitions.



         But that's down the road. That's work that we've got to demonstrate to ourselves, that there is a

         unique value proposition there. And then my view would be we'll leverage that to the full extent that

         we can. But that's true for any of the areas of our portfolio where we've got a substantial business

         today and ongoing technology work to make advances. That's, I think, really what's going to

         underpin where we focus our attention.



Doug Leggate: Thank you.



Jennifer Driscoll:      And as a reminder, we would like you to limit yourself to single question. Thanks.



Operator:            And we'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                  8
Devin McDermott:     Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.



Darren Woods: Good morning.



Devin McDermott:     So, I want to stick with the Permian, but I'm not going to ask an M&A question, I wanted

        to ask about the results you're seeing there. And if you look at the production in the quarter, you

        guys reported 615,000 barrels a day. It's strong sequential growth versus 4Q and also puts you

        already in line with that 10% growth target that you had laid out for 2023. So, I was wondering if you

        could talk a little bit about the productivity trends and the driver of the strong results that you're

        seeing there, and then also, how you're thinking about the evolution of production for the balance of

        this year?



Darren Woods: Yeah, good morning. I would say we haven't changed our year-end targets, and so the

        guidance that we gave as part of the corporate plan discussion last year continues to hold. I think

        we've said in the past that, as you look at production in the Permian, it's going to be a little bit lumpy.

        And so, I wouldn't take any one data point, any one quarter's numbers, and extrapolate from there. I

        think you're going to see some movement in that up and down. I would say, generally speaking, we

        like what we're seeing in terms of productivity in the Permian. You all know several years ago, our

        strategy on maximizing oil recovery versus initial production rates, that led to a very different

        development approach trying to work across this cube design, work across all the benches

        simultaneously to maximize ultimate recovery.



        That, I think we've been developing that approach, fine tuning it, testing it, and evolving that concept.

        We like where we've gotten to with that approach. I think we're seeing the results of that starting to

        manifest itself. Our expectation is that we'll continue to, I think, differentiate our production and




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                    9
        what we're able to do versus many of our other competitors who started off on this best bench, high

        initial production rates. With time, I expect to see them pivot, maybe a similar approach, but I think

        we've got a real good head start on that. Like what we're doing there. I think we see some

        encouraging signs on the early stages of that. And we're going to keep pressing on that, maintain

        rigs and the capital levels that we've been talking about pretty consistently, and then we'll see how

        the rest of the year plays out. But we're sticking at this point to the same year-end guidance that we

        gave late last year.



Devin McDermott:     Great. Thanks, Darren.



Darren Woods: Welcome.



Operator:        We'll go next to John Royall with JP Morgan.



John Royall:     Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.



Darren Woods: Good morning.



John Royall:     So, on the Beaumont expansion, can you talk about how the capacity is being absorbed in

        the market? And given what's happened to cracks and the general concerns around demand today,

        and granted I think Darren's commentary on the market was probably a bit more positive, but are

        there any concerns about adding capacity at a time where fundamentals appear to be weakening?



Darren Woods: Yes. I would say the short answer is, no. Look, we all know these markets are volatile, that

        they move up and down.        We focused, I'll remind you, on the Beaumont expansion.          This is

        something that we began planning and developing many, many years ago. And it was really built on




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                              10
        the Permian production and the changes in transportation differentials by bringing crude into the

        front end of the Beaumont refinery and making the intermediate products to fill our conversion

        capacity and backing out imports of intermediates and saving the transportation of those

        intermediates that are typically coming from afar.



        And so, we justified that project on a transportation differential and felt that provided a reasonable

        return, and with the expectation that, on top of that, we would see the value of additional fuels and

        the higher-value products that we are producing, exactly what we're seeing today. It is very well

        positioned on the cost of supply curve. And frankly, that's how you need to think about this business.

        So irrespective of where the margins go, our view is all of our facilities need to be on the far left of

        the curve so that we've got a difference between the marginal price setter. And I have every

        expectation that the capacity that we brought on in Beaumont will - I know - is on the far left-hand

        side of the cost of supply curve. So, feel pretty good about its competitiveness.



John Royall:     Thank you.



Darren Woods: You bet.



Operator:        We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.



Sam Margolin:    Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.



Darren Woods: Good morning, Sam.



Sam Margolin:    So, I think, looking at the numbers, what sort of jumps off the page is the cash balance. And

        you've been pretty transparent about this topic and the imperative to build a fortress balance sheet.




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                11
        But I wonder if the direction we're going with cash, even net of shareholder returns that are

        continuing to increase and that are well within your targets, if we're kind of getting beyond fortress

        and into something even bigger than that.



        And if there's any thought around the absolute level of cash today and really what's optimal. And I'll

        catch that with, historically, Exxon had kept a very lean balance sheet on both sides relative to the

        production base and the cash flow base. And so, it's a little bit different than the history of the

        company, and so I would appreciate your thoughts on it. Thank you.



Kathy Mikells:   Sure. I'll go ahead and take that, Sam. I mean, our capital allocation approach, I think, has

        been very consistent and very clear. And we had talked about the fact that we would expect our

        cash balance post the end of the year to kind of ebb and flow depending on how market prices and

        margins evolve. So, I'd say we're very comfortable with where we stand. It's important for us to have

        a really strong balance sheet in order to ensure that we stick to our capital allocation priorities

        through the cycle, right? That's investing in the business and competitively advantaged high-return

        projects. It's maintaining a very strong balance sheet. You know that balance sheet gives us all the

        firepower and confidence we need to succeed across a very wide variety of market conditions, which

        is obviously what this industry faces. And then clearly, we're looking to share our success with

        shareholders, and you see that through a more consistent share repurchase program and a growing

        dividend. So, we feel pretty good about our cash balance.



        I would just also mention that we're in a relatively unusual market environment compared to what

        we've seen in the past. ExxonMobil's average debt rate is about 3%. You can look up what people

        are earning on short-term cash. I think three-month treasuries are at 5% today. So, right now, we're

        not incurring a negative cost of carry on that cash balance, and that's certainly one of the things that

        we look at as well. So, we feel really good about where we're at today in our balance sheet.




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                12
Darren Woods: Yes. And I would add, Sam, I think you mentioned history. And in recent history, it's certainly

        true that we ran fairly lean on cash. But if you go further back to some of the really high cycles, we

        carried more cash, and it reflected the commodity cycle and the nature that typically we're bringing a

        lot of cash on the top of the commodity cycle. But that's an important asset as you move into the

        bottom of the cycle, particularly when you're trying to maintain the consistent investment levels and

        continue to advance the projects in the portfolio.



        So, I think at times when the markets are on the high end of the cycle, I would expect to see cash

        balances higher so that we're well positioned as we go into the low end of the cycle, which we know

        will come. Question is obviously when that will come.



Sam Margolin:    Thank you so much.



Darren Woods: Thank you.



Operator:        We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.



Roger Read:      Thank you. Good morning.



Darren Woods: Good morning, Roger.



Roger Read:      What I'd like to ask on the specific commentary about the $7.2 billion in savings on track for

        the $9 billion this year. Could you characterize a little bit where that's come from to-date, how kind

        of general inflation within, not just the oil field, but in general, how that's affecting that? And is $9

        billion the end of the program, or is there something to happen beyond that? I know I'm kind of




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                 13
        asking three questions in one, but they're all focused right around the $7 billion to $9 billion. So, if

        you allow me, I'll throw that out.



Kathy Mikells:   I'll try and circle around that kind of suite of questions for you, Roger. So, I'd start by saying,

        overall, we feel really good about the progress that we've made. We're very much on track for the

        $9 billion at the end of this year relative to 2019. If you look overall at where a number of, I'd say,

        different programs are driving savings for us, one is just improving the overall productivity across our

        workforce. If you think about how that's manifested itself in Upstream, it's been a significant

        reduction in what I would describe as above-field cost that's been a real focus of that organization.

        We've made a number of different organizational changes over the past couple of years. I would

        describe those generally as looking to centralize key functions across the company that have been

        done disparately.



        Previously, our global projects organization would be a great example of that. Last year, more

        recently, the combination of our Upstream - I'm sorry our Downstream and Chem organization - into

        our Product Solutions business, a lot of simplification coming across that business as a result,

        combining our engineering and research kind of groups collectively together and then just recently

        announcing the combination of our supply chain across the organization and setting up a global

        business services organization and combining our global trading capabilities across the company.

        And so that's all about improving the experience for our employees, for our vendors, for our

        customers, and continuing to drive efficiencies and, importantly, effectiveness across those

        organizations.



        We would have seen actually the benefit of some of that in this recent quarter. We talked a little bit

        in our presentation about the fact that our maintenance activities, we had a pretty heavy turnaround

        quarter, and those maintenance activities really came in at the first quartile. So much better than




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                    14
        what we had planned for, shorter duration. That enabled us, obviously, to have better throughput

        than we would have been planning overall for the quarter. And so that's a big area of savings for us.

        And that's another organization that we have recently centralized in our global operations and

        sustainability group. So that gives you, I'd say, a little bit of a characterization of where savings are

        coming from. And certainly, some of the more recent changes that we've made in the organization,

        we'd expect to drive efficiencies and effectiveness going forward from here.



        And then just the last comment: does the program end? So just to be clear, we've talked about a

        specific time period externally because we thought that would be helpful in transparency. Internally,

        we don't actually manage this as, hey, there's one time period that we're focused on as opposed to

        we are focused on continuing to drive structural cost savings over time. Those are embedded in the

        plans that we shared with you last December. And obviously, we'll be doing an update when we

        come to the end of the year. And so, we'll talk in more detail about what we see from there on a go-

        forward basis.



Darren Woods: And the final point I'd make to build on what Kathy said is we have seen with all these

        organizational changes, as our people have come together in the new organizations and focused on

        the objectives of those organizations and what the corporation is trying to achieve, we find a lot

        more opportunities than we could envision even going into the changes. So, my expectation is as

        these new organizations come together, they'll begin to find things. The organizational changes

        we've already made are continuing to find things. So, our expectation as we head into the future is

        we'll continue to drive efficiencies and deliver structural cost savings on to the bottom line.



Kathy Mikells:   And then I'll just circle back. You asked a little bit about inflation. We actually have put an

        additional disclosure in our press release, so I'd encourage you to look at that. If you look at the

        quarter, we more than offset inflationary cost pressure with the structural savings that we were able




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                 15
        to generate. Overall, I'd say, the organization is doing a good job at looking to offset inflation in

        what's obviously been a higher inflation environment recently.



Roger Read:      Thank you.



Kathy Mikells:   Welcome.



Operator:        We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.



Jason Gabelman:          Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on the

        Downstream business given your global reach there. We're seeing reports that Asian refiners are

        contemplating run cuts while margins in the US are still really robust. And I'm wondering if you see

        that dynamic as kind of balanced, where cracks in Asia are zero but margins in the US are still 20, and

        that's kind of representative of the market structure that we're in. Or do you expect the weakness in

        Asia margins to force US refining margins lower in the near-term? Thanks.



Darren Woods: Yeah, sure, I'll take that. I think the first comment I would make is over some period of time,

        and it's typically pretty short, the world balances. And we always use the phrase the world is round.

        So, it's hard to stay disconnected. The margins eventually have to equilibrate on transportation

        differentials.    And so that's the model that I have in my mind.       There are always short-term

        disruptions.      You certainly saw that coming out of the pandemic with some of the logistics

        constraints. So, there will obviously be periods of time where things constrain that. But generally

        speaking, that happens.



        I think the margins in the US will be a function of what production source is setting the marginal layer

        of production. As I said earlier, that has historically come out of Europe. And their cost structures




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                16
        have increased, and so that marginal barrel is now higher, which is underpinning higher Gulf Coast

        refining. I don’t, frankly, see that changing in the short-term. Obviously, if additional capacity comes

        on, it's much lower cost. And that supply overwhelms any growth in demand, and we'll see the

        marginal price setter changed.       And then with time, that will get balanced out based on

        transportation differentials.



        My sense of things is if you look back to last year and the export levels coming out of China and the

        balances in Asia that stayed reasonably tight. The question will be, do we see the same thing this

        year. And I think time will tell.



Jason Gabelman:       All right. Thanks.



Darren Woods: You bet.



Operator:        We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.



Stephen Richardson: Hi, thanks. This maybe a bit of a follow-up on the questions previously about cost

        structure and the balance sheet. But I was wondering, Darren, if you could just address how and

        remind us how you're thinking about dividend growth, right? Because we've got clear evidence here

        that you've got foundational earnings growth. You've got projects that are coming on sooner and

        bigger if you look at Guyana, the Permian is doing well, you’re adding base capacity downstream. So

        just wondering if you could remind us on a mid-cycle basis how to think about - and how the Board

        thinks about - dividend growth. Because certainly you've de-risked some of those foundational

        earnings.




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                17
Darren Woods: Yeah, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Kathy to build on. But I would just say, generally, as

        we think about the dividend, we try to keep the long-term in mind and also be extremely conscious

        of the commodity cycles, and the variability and the volatility that we see in the marketplace and

        making sure that we establish a level of dividends that are reliable, sustainable, and I'd like to see

        those grow with time. That's been our history. That's what you've seen us do. And you see us fight,

        certainly during the pandemic year, fight really hard to make sure that we sustain that.



        And that’s, I think, a commitment that I feel really strong about. And so, it’s really about making sure

        that what we do there is sustainable for the long-term. And then obviously, we can balance

        disbursement – shareholder disbursements - with buybacks. But I think maintaining a long-term

        perspective and making sure our shareholders feel rewarded through the dividend policy is an

        underlying principle. Kathy, do you want to add anything to that?



Kathy Mikells:   Yeah, I'd say we look to take a very balanced approach as we think about shareholder

        distributions and getting that balance between a growing competitive dividend, right, as well as the

        efficiency through share repurchases. And I think we're striking a pretty even balance in that regard.

        And we definitely think about this over the long term as opposed to the near term, given we're in a

        business that's highly cyclical.



        And so, you've seen us in the last two years raise the dividend in the fourth quarter of the year.

        We're never going to get out in front of the Board of Directors. It's obviously something that we look

        at regularly, and we know it's important to ensure that dividend is competitive and growing. And

        about 40% of our shareholders are retail shareholders, so more of the moms and pops across the

        globe that are investors. And so, we know it's important. It's something we're really focused on.



Stephen Richardson: Thank you very much.




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                   18
Darren Woods: Thank you.



Operator:        We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.



Ryan Todd:       Great. Thanks. Maybe a question on the chemicals business. You saw sequential margin

        improvement in your Chemicals Products business driven by advantaged ethane pricing. Have we

        turned the corner in the chemical’s environment? And can you talk about how you see the trajectory

        of margins in that business over the course of 2023?



Darren Woods: Sure. I'll start then and then, Kathy, if you got anything to add to it. I think, these - like all the

        businesses that we're in - the underlying drivers of the chemical margins tend to be the commodity

        chemicals that are driven by supply/demand and the balances or imbalances in supply/demand. The

        margin, we saw a lot of capacity come on. You remember, as we went through the pandemic, a lot

        of investments got stalled and pulled back. And then as we came out, those got turned back on

        again and have come on to the marketplace. We've seen a lot of capacity coming on. I expect we'll

        still see some of that come on here in the short term.



        And then in conjunction with that, the COVID impacts took a while for it to unwind through, what I'd

        say, is the global economy, which impacted chemical demand. As you know, it's very tied to

        economic activity. So, if economic activity is constrained, then chemical demand is constrained. And

        we certainly saw that with the China lockdowns. Where we're at now is, that capacity is out there

        and on and it's just a question of where demand goes. And frankly, I think it's early with China. We

        do see some promising signs, but we'll have to see how China demand and their economic activity

        picks up.




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                    19
        The other point I would make is, feed and feed optimization is a big part of the margin equation as

        well. We've got some fairly diverse assets with respect to the ability to manage feed and change

        feedstocks around. As gas prices came off, that gave us a better liquid to gas spread that allowed us

        to change some of our feed into our crackers and get the advantage of that. So that was a help in

        the first quarter, some of that feed optimization. And that will play into it as well. And I think that's

        what you saw in the first quarter. And then the more macro impacts, we'll see how they play out as

        we go forward. Kathy, anything?



Kathy Mikells:   Yes. The only other thing I'd add is, we obviously brought on our Baton Rouge chemical

        expansion project late in the fourth quarter. That's spooled up in the first quarter. That's part of an

        overall strategy of growing Performance Chemicals along with growing high-value products across

        our Product Solutions business, be it performance chemicals or low emission fuels, high-value lubes.



        And so, even though the market has been tough, that project actually had a positive earnings and

        cash flow contribution for us in the quarter. So that's a big part of our overall strategy and mixing up

        in both the Chemical business and across our Product Solutions business. And we feel very good

        about the results that's bringing. And we obviously have an advantage in a very heavy US Gulf Coast

        footprint kind of relative to the global footprint, and that helped us in the sequential improvement in

        margins.



Darren Woods: Yes. It's a great example of where we're focused on advantaged projects that bring on

        advantaged low-cost capacity. So that polypropylene unit that we brought on in really what is a

        pretty low point in the polypropylene market to make positive earnings on a brand-new piece of kit

        that starts up in the lowest of the cycle is, I think, a testament to the strength of the projects that we

        are investing in and bringing online.

Operator:        We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.



Alastair Syme:   Hello.    Darren and Kathy, thanks very much.         I wonder if I could just ask about unit

        depreciation trends. There's quite a big change first-quarter versus fourth quarter in depreciation. Is

        that some of the portfolio effect in the year that we should be picking up? How does that rate

        through the year then?



Kathy Mikells:   Sure. I'm happy to answer that. What you tend to see in depreciation is some ebbs and

        flows associated with our asset management activities.             And so, when we're selling assets,

        sometimes we're taking a small impairment that runs through depreciation. And so, I'd say you kind

        of have to take a step back from that noise in depreciation. If I put that to the side, the company has

        run about, I'll call it, $19 billion, $20 billion annually in depreciation and amortization. So, that's how I

        think about it.



Alastair Syme:   Okay. Thank you.



Operator:        We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.



Biraj Borkhataria:   Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on trading because there's

        been various press reports about Exxon wanting to build up its capabilities in asset optimization and




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                                     21
        trading. And I was just wondering where you are in that journey. Because, obviously, we've seen

        some exceptional volatility in 2022 and early this year across oil and gas.



        And if I look at some of the numbers from some of your peers, it looks like that those businesses, the

        asset and optimization could add up to 5% on ROCE in an exceptional environment. So, you

        obviously have a big advantage with your refining footprint and your asset base. I'm just wondering

        how sort of vigorously are you pursuing this opportunity? And how long do you expect it to take to

        get to where you want to be on the trading front? Thank you.



Darren Woods: Sure. And good morning, Biraj. Thanks for the question. I think putting aside the press

        reports of the media, we've talked about this, I think, starting back in 2018. And what triggered our

        emphasis on trading and the emphasis that we're putting on trading is the reorganization that we

        made coming out of the functional organizational construct into value chains. And as you move into

        the value chains, the opportunity to trade along that value chain and generate insights and

        advantage along the value chain changes pretty dramatically. And so that move to a value chain

        construct that we had early on between Refining and Downstream we now have that with our

        Product Solutions organization. We've now integrated our Upstream into those value chains, and so,

        we've got a really streamlined and good view of the marketplace.



        And so, we can now trade all along the entire length of the value chain, we can trade across those

        value chains. And then obviously, we can take advantage of the global footprint as you referenced

        and trade along that global footprint and arbitrage between the markets. And so, I think our

        organizational construct today gives us a much better line of sight and opportunity to optimize in the

        trading space. So, we started growing that in 2018. That has been what I would say is on a

        continuum of growth. We like what we see there. We brought talent in there. We've traded for a




ExxonMobil 1Q23 Earnings Call                                                                              22
        long time. We just gave the trading organizations within the company some different objective

        statements, and they've done really well responding to that, bringing value to the bottom line.



        And what we just announced is taking the trading organizations that today are somewhat dispersed

        through the organization and consolidating those into one centralized trading organization for the

        whole of the corporation. We think that makes a lot of sense. We did a lot of work over the last

        couple of years to validate what we thought the opportunity size was there and what would be

        needed to get after that. And we're now, I'd say, in execution mode with respect to putting the

        organization together, putting in the support systems, bringing in the talent, developing the talent,

        and growing the talent in that space.



        And so, I would just think of it as a progression, a continuation with what we believe is a huge

        opportunity. And we're going to do that in a very thoughtful, controlled pace, but one that is very

        focused on significantly growing the value proposition there, really around our footprint. This is not

        about going out and taking speculative positions. This is about going out and optimizing, given the

        asset base that we have, the value chains that we're participating in, taking the insights generated

        from running those businesses and the opportunities that come with those insights and transacting

        on them. That's what the organization is going to be doing.



        And like I said, even in the short time, we've seen some really good results. I think we've got a clear

        line of sight to some additional ones. And the value of that opportunity will manifest itself in our

        business that the - this is really around trading on the value created through the transformation of

        molecules and developing products that people want and then moving those products around the

        world. And so that platform gives our traders a great base to optimize off of. That's where we'll see

        the value accrue.

Biraj Borkhataria:   That's very helpful. Just if possible, a quick follow-up. But does that change at all the

        way you look to manage your cash balances going forward? I'm thinking about relative to prior

        cycles. If you have a higher kind of exposure to trading, maybe you would like to run with a high cash

        generally. Am I wrong in that? Any color would be helpful.



Kathy Mikells:   So, we obviously take the company's working capital needs into consideration as we think

        about our balance sheet and our cash balance. All else held equal, a bigger company means a bigger

        working capital needs. So that's how I would think about it. I'd also say, as it relates to trading

        generally, I mean, there's some near-term, I would say, working capital that has to be brought in

        mind in terms of the trading organization. The profits that come through trading are different

        quarter-to-quarter, but I'd say year-to-year, pretty steady.



Biraj Borkhataria:   Got it. Thank you.

Darren Woods: Good morning, Paul.



Paul Cheng:      Thank you. Can you give us an update where you are on in Mozambique and also in the

        Papua New Guinea LNG, in terms of the Papua New Guinea expansion talk?

Darren Woods: Yeah. I think just I'd speak to maybe the LNG portfolio as a whole. We're making good

        progress there, specifically, working through project concepts and designs and making sure that

        we're developing projects that are going to be on that left-hand side of cost of supply curve. We're

        bringing on production is very competitive in the marketplace to make sure that for the long-term,

        we have a robust supply point there. I think good progress in both PNG and Mozambique with

        respect to that. We've had good progress with the government in PNG in terms of getting the

        agreements that we need signed and helping us move forward. We're working with our partner

        there, Total. So, feel good about the progress that we’re making there.



        And then with Mozambique, obviously, been on hold for a while, given some of the challenges there.

        We’ll continue to keep close eye on that, and as the situation improves and we feel comfortable that

        we can successfully go in there and develop the project, we’ll take steps to go do that in conjunction

        with Total and the work that they're doing there.



Paul Cheng:      Darren, can I ask, in Mozambique Total seems to be optimistic about the security on the

        ground there, just working through on the cost structure with the contractor. Do you guys still have

        concern on security, or are you going through the similar process to turn on the cost structure side?



Darren Woods: Yeah. We work very closely with Total, obviously, given the same exposures and the work

        that we're doing together. So, I'd tell you it's kind of a hand-in-hand approach that we're taking

        there, sharing information. We've had our own security folks out there assessing the situation. I

        would say our assessment is very consistent with Total's assessment.          We don't see a lot of

        difference between what the conclusions they're coming up with and our conclusion. So, we do like

        the progress that we've seen there. Obviously, we need to be convinced that we’ll sustain that

        progress. And today, I feel pretty optimistic about that.
