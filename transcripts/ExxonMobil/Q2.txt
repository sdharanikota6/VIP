Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                   1
        I’m pleased to be conducting our earnings call from our Houston campus. As of July 1st, our

        corporate headquarters is now located at the campus, alongside the senior managers of our

        businesses and centralized organizations. This is the first time in the company’s history that the

        senior leadership team of the corporation is located on one site and represents a critical step in

        continuing the transformation of our business enabling us to improve collaboration and alignment

        and further leverage synergies across our integrated businesses.



        The ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained, industry-leading

        performance was clearly demonstrated in our second-quarter results.



        We delivered earnings of almost $8 billion, two times higher than what we earned in the second

        quarter of 2018, under comparable industry commodity prices. That doubling of earnings reflects

        our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advantaged

        projects, and drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do.



        With these results, I would like to take a moment to recognize our people, starting with all those that

        made the move to Houston. I’m sure you know moves like this are not easy and that many personal

        sacrifices are made. I’m very thankful for all who did this. Their willingness to disrupt their lives for

        the benefit of our company is a testament to the dedication of our people whose commitment and

        hard work underpin all the improvements we are making. I hope our shareholders take comfort in

        this one, small example of our people’s commitment to the company and have confidence in their

        resolve to further strengthen our position as an industry leader in all that we do.



        Our achievements this quarter also demonstrate the progress we’re making in solving the “and”

        equation: meeting the world’s needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions, both

        our own and others’.

        In the Permian, we set another production record and remain on track for an overall growth in

        production of 10% this year. As I said last quarter, our growth won’t be linear as we execute our

        development plans that balance and optimize capital efficiency, resource recovery, and production

        rates. Our priority will remain on driving value, not volumes.



        In Guyana, we achieved a record quarterly gross production rate of 380,000 barrels per day. Our

        team in Guyana continues to deliver excellent operating, environmental, and safety results while

        optimizing and growing production. In fact, we see the potential to increase the combined gross

        capacity of these two FPSOs to above 400 thousand barrels per day with further debottlenecking,

        which is nearly a 20% increase above the investment basis and a testament to the ingenuity of our

        people.



        In the Gulf Coast, we continue to profitably grow our business. In the second quarter we achieved

        mechanical completion of the Baytown chemical expansion. The project grows volume and

        improves mix with 750 thousand tons per annum of additional performance chemical products.



        The Baytown expansion is the final Product Solutions component of the “Growing the Gulf” initiative

        announced in 2017. If you recall, the initiative committed to investments of $20 billion over ten years

        to capitalize on the U.S.’s advantaged resources, economic growth, and strong regional support for

        our businesses and the jobs we create. Eleven of the thirteen projects are up and running. The

        Baytown expansion, after product qualifications, should begin contributing by the fourth quarter…

        and Golden Pass, the last of our “Growing the Gulf” projects, should have its first train up at the back

        end of 2024.

        The “Growing the Gulf” initiative is another example of executing our strategy – investing in

        advantaged, high-value growth, and delivering on our commitments.



        Improving the earnings power of our businesses also requires divestments. In the second quarter we

        completed the divestment of the Billings refinery. Including this sale, cash proceeds from

        divestments of non-strategic assets have totalled roughly $2 billion year-to-date.



        In advancing our efforts to better leverage corporate scale and integration, we established three new

        centralized organizations in the quarter – consolidating activities previously embedded in each of our

        businesses: Global Business Solutions, ExxonMobil Supply Chain, and Global Trading. They’re all off

        to a good start and have clear lines of sight to improve performance and lower cost.


        Our Low Carbon Solutions business continues to make progress in building an advantaged, low cost,

        high-return business in capturing, transporting, and storing carbon. We announced a CO 2 offtake

        agreement with Nucor, one of North America’s largest steel producers.                And we signed an

        agreement to acquire Denbury, which will provide ExxonMobil with the largest owned and operated

        network of CO2 pipelines in the United States.



        Combining Denbury’s assets and experience with our capabilities will significantly accelerate and

        expand our ability to profitably help customers reduce their emissions and allow ExxonMobil to play

        an even greater role in a thoughtful energy transition.



        It significantly enhances our competitive position and offers a compelling customer proposition to

        economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize heavy industries which, today, have limited,

        practical options.




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                    4
        Of Denbury’s 1,300 miles of CO2 pipeline, roughly 70% are in the Gulf Coast states of Louisiana,

        Texas, and Mississippi — one of the largest U.S. markets for CO2 reduction and home to some of

        ExxonMobil’s largest integrated refining and chemical sites and nine of their ten strategically-located

        CO2 storage sites are also in this region.



        We believe the transaction synergies will drive strong growth and returns. A cost-efficient

        transportation and storage system accelerates CCS deployment for both ExxonMobil and our third-

        party customers. It supports multiple low-carbon value chains – including CCS, hydrogen, ammonia,

        and biofuels.



        Ultimately, we see an opportunity to create a CCS business with the capacity to reduce emissions

        across the Gulf Coast by up to 100 million tons per year. This transaction will help us do that at a

        lower cost and faster pace. In fact, we see the potential for a third of the opportunity being

        actionable in the near term.



        Which takes us to our customers. Our latest offtake agreement extends our CCS customer base

        beyond industrial gas and fertilizers into steel. This project will tie into the same CO 2 transportation

        and storage infrastructure we’ll use to serve CF Industries, located just 10 miles from Nucor.

        Focusing our efforts and investments in areas with concentrated sources of emissions allows us to

        capture the benefits of scale, reduce our spend per ton of CO 2 captured and improves returns.



        Our work with Nucor supports Louisiana’s goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by

        2050 and it increases the total amount of CO2 we’ve agreed to transport and store for customers to

        5 million metric tons per year – equivalent to replacing 2 million cars with EVs, roughly the same

        number of electric vehicles on the road in the United States today. With the planned Denbury

        acquisition, the potential reduction could be up to 20 times that.

        As demonstrated by these new developments, we’re continuing to make significant progress in our

        plans to lead industry in helping society reduce emissions.



        A major component of our improved earnings is the structural cost savings that we’ve achieved –

        currently at $8.3 billion. We remain on track to reach our target of $9 billion in savings by the end of

        this year. As we develop plans for future years, we’re committed to finding additional savings.



        Cash flow from operations totaled $9.4 billion in the quarter, or $13 billion excluding the change in

        working capital.



        Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with the full-year

        guidance we shared last year as part of our Corporate Plan review.



        Capex investments totaled $12.5 billion year-to-date, also in line with our full-year guidance.



        And, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continue to share our success with

        shareholders, distributing $8.0 billion in cash during the quarter, including $4.3 billion in share

        repurchases and $3.7 billion in dividends.



        Before we go to Q&A, I’ll leave you with a few key takeaways from the quarter.



        First, our work to structurally improve earnings power is paying off, demonstrated this quarter as we

        doubled earnings versus a comparable price environment in the second quarter of 2018. Our

        reorganizations, aggressive investments in advantaged projects, and significant reductions in cost are

        driving value and improving our competitive position.

        We’ve made great progress and have a clear line of sight to much more. In the back half of this year

        alone, we expect to bring on two advantaged projects – Baytown Performance Chemicals and the

        Payara FPSO in Guyana – further growing our capacity to generate industry-leading earnings.



        The company’s ongoing business transformation is giving the organization a better view of end-to-

        end value creation and focusing us on the highest value opportunities. Today, we are better

        positioned than ever to realize the value of our scale and the synergies from improving the

        integration of our businesses.



        For the first time in our history, we have a corporate technology, projects, trading, supply chain, and

        business solutions organization allowing us to apply the best solutions and talent to our biggest

        opportunities. And, importantly, we are developing the most talented people in the industry,

        providing unrivaled opportunities to meet some of society’s greatest challenges.



        Their work is delivering exceptional results – driving industry-leading returns on investments, and

        growth in earnings and cash flow. This, in turn, allows us to distribute cash to shareholders through

        share repurchases and a sustained, competitive, and growing dividend while maintaining investments

        in industry advantaged projects including investments in our Low Carbon Solutions business. By

        leveraging the advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we are laying the foundation for a

        world-scale, competitively-advantaged, low carbon business with industry-leading returns. The

        planned acquisition of Denbury is a step in that direction, improving our decarbonization proposition

        for customers, while generating attractive returns.

        In summary, we’re pleased with the quarter, the progress it represents and the improved earnings

        power of the company. We’re confident that we have the right strategy with the right leadership and

        the best people to effectively execute it – delivering sustained growth in shareholder value.



        With that, let me turn it back to Jennifer.



Jennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Darren . We'll now begin our Q&A session. Please note that we continue to

        request that analysts ask a single question as a courtesy to the other analysts. However, please

        remain on the line in case we need any clarifying questions. And with that operator, please open the

        line for our first question.



Operator: Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you'd

        like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the star key, followed by the digit one on your

        touchtone telephone. And we'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America



Doug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Darren, I wonder if I could pick up on the cost saving

        target and I guess my question is post-Denbury and given that, you know, we're already halfway

        through 2023, where does that $9 billion cost saving target go through the end of the plan period

        through 2027?



Darren Woods: It goes up, Doug. In short, I think, as you know, we've been talking about the reorganizations

        that we've been executing over the years, with some of them just recently executed, puts us in a

        position to really capture a lot of efficiencies across the whole of the enterprise this year as we

        develop our corporate plans. Obviously, one of the objectives of these new organizations is to take

        stock of what they've got in their portfolio and identify the opportunities to further capture the

        benefits of scale and the synergies that exist between the integrated businesses and what, for the




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                  8
        first time, represents an opportunity to actually manage processes across these integrated

        businesses. So I think we've got an opportunity set to drive that cost reduction even further as we

        head out further in the plan horizon. And my expectation is when we come back at the end of the

        year after we've developed the plans, reviewed them with the board, and then share them with all of

        you… we'll provide some perspective on what that opportunity looks like going forward.



Doug Leggate: Would you care to offer an order of magnitude, Darren?



Kathy Mikells: You know, Doug, I’d tell you to go back to the Investor Day material from March of 2022. We

        had some bridges in it where we kind of laid out earnings and how much structural cost savings were

        driving earnings improvement relative to volume and mix. And I think if you just look at the size of

        those bars, you'll get a rough order of magnitude.



Doug Leggate: I meant going forward. But I'll leave it there. Thanks .



Darren Woods: You bet. Thank you, Doug .



Operator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs .



Neil Mehta: Good morning. Darren, you've been clear that you think that there's value to be had potentially in

        M&A, in both low carbon and in the Permian and Denbury, clearly well into the into the former of

        those two. I'd be curious on your perspective on the M&A markets right now and how are you

        thinking about approaching opportunistic value creation to that?



Darren Woods: Yeah, good morning, Neil. I would say that our perspective on that whole space, and I know

        it's one that's of great interest and we've talked about it seems like for a number of successive




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                  9
        quarters, hasn't really changed, quite frankly. I think what we are holding ourselves to and evaluating

        opportunities in that space is the ability to create unique value, unique shareholder value. And so, the

        opportunities have to be bigger than what ExxonMobil or any potential acquisition could do

        independent of one another. So I think you've heard us say that one plus one has to equal three

        here. And that's how we're thinking about that space. You know, obviously from the very beginning,

        back in 2018, when we started talking about better leveraging our key competitive advantages, one

        of the drives to do that is to open up value opportunities that basically others can’t achieve. And as

        I've tried to make clear in this quarter's prepared remarks and in previous quarters, we're making

        great progress on better leveraging those competitive advantages, bringing them to bear on the

        business, delivering bottom line results. The more we do that, the more we advance our technology

        portfolio, the bigger the opportunity to identify unique value opportunities with other

        companies. And so we're continuing to look for that. But we're not going to compromise our

        expectation of generating returns and growing value for shareholders. So I think Kathy's said many

        times in the past we're pretty picky acquirers. I don't see us changing that position.



Neil Mehta: Thanks, Darren



Darren Woods: You bet, Neil .



Operator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.



Devin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.



Darren Woods: Good morning.




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                   10
Devin McDermott: So I wanted to ask about the Permian. You've had strong results so far this year and in the

        slides you had some interesting charts and some of the advantages you see versus peers and how

        you developed the asset. I was wondering if we could dive into a little bit more detail on that. When

        you think about some of the specific drivers that allow you to get such better NPV versus other cube

        development in the basin. What are those in your view? And as part of that, could you address the

        resource recovery trends you're seeing in the improvement there? And any room for further upside

        on that?



Darren Woods: Yeah, sure. I guess I’ll maybe start by going back to the approach we outlined in the 2018,

        2019 timeframe where we said, you know, ExxonMobil can bring a different game to the

        unconventional space and really bring to bear and leverage the capabilities that we have versus many

        others who are competing in that space. And, key amongst those was, taking advantage of our scale

        and balance sheet to develop this asset at scale. And so you may recall we talked about the cube

        development, which was really focusing on how you maximize overall recovery and not near-term

        production. That wasn't a particularly well received approach back in 2018/19 timeframe. But I think,

        with time, it's demonstrated its value and it's actually manifesting itself in the results that you see

        today, which is we're focused on making sure that as we develop the resources and all the benches

        in that resources, particularly the ones that are connected, that we do that in an optimum way that

        develops and maximizes the recovery versus initial production rates. And so that's really

        important. That cube development, we continue to evolve that. I think we’ve gotten to a stage now

        where we feel really good about how we're executing that development. We focused on capital

        efficiency and I would tell you today we are setting records for the length of our lateral wells, which

        again lowers the cost associated with accessing the resource. And importantly, as you drill longer

        wells, it's critical to that, the productivity of each foot of that well remains constant. And so we've

        done a lot of work to make sure that the productivity of each foot is consistent as we drill longer, and

        longer. So that's driving capital costs down pretty significantly. And then I would say we've got a lot

        of technologies that we're trialing, ones that I won't go into specific detail on to try to maximize

        recovery. And we've got those technologies deployed in the field. We've got some early results that

        are quite encouraging, but they aren't at the scale today to manifest themselves completely in our

        results. So I think all those things together continue to give us a lot of confidence that not only have

        we moved to the front of the pack and demonstrated industry leadership with what we've got today,

        that we see a lot of upside to that as we move forward. And I don't think we've reached the end of

        the optimization process yet.



Devin McDermott: Great. Thanks Darren.



Darren Woods: You bet.



Operator: Okay. We'll go next to John Royall with JP Morgan.



John Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So just looking at your bridge for Energy

        Products, and you have over $2 billion of negative margin, it's right in line with the number out of

        your 8-K. So no surprises there, but definitely a bigger decline on a relative basis than we're seeing

        from your couple of peers that have reported so far. So just looking for any additional color on the

        drivers of that margin decline. Maybe there's something to call out around regional mix or crude

        slates that are a bit more unique to Exxon?



Kathy Mikells: Yeah, I wouldn't say there's anything unique. I mean, this is a straight flow through of just what

        the industry refining margin reduction is kind of flowing through. You know, we would see a much

        bigger reduction coming out of where we have a bigger footprint. So I would say even though the

        U.S. tends to have better margins than the rest of the world, we obviously have a very big footprint in

        the U.S. and so just that footprint drives the bigger absolute number and absolute decline. But it's

        just a straight flow through from the change in industry margin.



Darren Woods: Yeah, the size of our refining business is much, much larger than our peers. So the impacts

        associated with the changes in those margins have a bigger impact on us than you see with our

        peers.



John Royall: Sure. I was just looking and it's kind of like a 50% cut to the 1Q number on the margin side. But

        thank you very much. I appreciate it.



Darren Woods: You bet.



Operator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo .



Roger Read: Yeah. Hello. Good morning.



Darren Woods: Good morning, Roger.



Kathy Mikells: Good morning.



Roger Read: I'd like to follow up on on the chemicals margin. You made the comment on the opening about

        pricing, where it was in 2018, but margins much better. That said, chemicals isn't quite back to the

        2021 high point. So anything else you can offer on how the chemical outlook is getting any

        better? And one of the reasons I asked that question is when we look at the softness in NGL prices in

        the U.S. and this expectation of much higher exports, we hear talk about, you know, increase in




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                 13
        China chemical capacity. So how should we kind of juxtapose what looks like an improving market

        for you? Certainly better margins versus potentially a lot of new capacity into that area?



Darren Woods: Yeah, sure. I'll give you a couple of perspectives on that and then see if Kathy has anything to

        add. I think, first of all, what I'd say is the work that we've done over the years to make sure that

        we've got a well-diversified feed slate for our chemicals business continues to pay off as, particularly

        in these markets as things are shifting around and price spreads are moving, our organizations are

        pretty adept at responding to those price signals and change in feed. So that continues to make its

        way to the bottom line and position us better than many of our peers with that flexibility and the feed

        optionality that we have. I think as you look around the world, you know, early on there with China,

        being in COVID lockdown and recognizing the role that it has in chemicals demand, that was kind of

        the back half of last year impact. And as we've come into this year I think a lot of expectations for

        China to pick up. And with that growth in demand in chemicals, we are seeing that starting to

        happen. In fact, if you look at ourselves in chemicals, the second quarter was stronger than the first

        quarter. So we are seeing that, the demand looks pretty reasonable, I would say. I mean, the big

        challenge is, and you referenced it, is the amount of supply that's come on and that's where I think

        our feedstock advantages and our footprint and the integration that we have with a number of

        refineries around the world actually positions us better. But it will take some time. It is my

        expectation for demand to kind of take us out of the excess supply that we've got on the

        marketplace, but I would just add that, you know, we've made a lot of investment in chemicals over

        the last five years, fairly significant investments. And one of the things that frankly, I'm quite

        pleased with is, if you look at all those chemical investments that we've brought online, even in the

        depths of what is a pretty low bottom of cycle condition for our chemical business , all of those brand

        new projects are earnings positive and cash positive, which I think really bodes well for when the

        market comes back up and we're at top of cycle. So I feel good about how we’ve positioned the

        business and, frankly, we're doing exactly what we had hoped for, which is when you get into tough




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                   14
        conditions that our business continues to outperform competition and so puts us in a good position

        that as markets tighten back up again and margins improve will be in even better position.



Kathy Mikells:   And I’d just add a couple of quick stats to that. So relative to competition, again, our

        geographic footprint is pretty advantaged. And so we're about 35% larger in North America than I’d

        call it rest of industry. And then the other thing I'd point out that gets to what Darren just said about

        some of the projects we've been implementing, those projects help to support an improvement in

        our overall mix. And so this quarter we saw a 6% increase in performance chemical products and

        those carry a higher margin. So those are some of the more systemic things that help to drive

        improvement relative to competitors.



Roger Read: Great. Thank you. A follow up question on the carbon capture side of the business. If we look,

        we've got global coal demand hitting a record in ‘23. Global oil demand is going to hit a record in ‘23

        if it hasn't already. Just curious, Darren, you've already laid out your strategy. All that makes

        sense. The Denbury acquisition certainly fits well in that. Just curious if you're getting any additional,

        sort of, outside pressure to maybe accelerate something on this, given that if you think about it from

        an energy transition standpoint, you know, two or three years ago everybody was saying we would

        have already had peak demand for this. Peak demand for that is clearly not happening. If we're going

        to have a lot more carbon emissions, are you getting any additional pressure to accelerate carbon

        capture?



Darren Woods: Yeah, I think what you're seeing today is a reflection of the challenge that the world

        faces, and, frankly, an incomplete solution set. And I think, you know unfortunately, if you go back

        several years, I would say the exclusive focus on wind, solar and EVs and the fact that other

        alternatives and other solutions that, frankly, at the time we were advocating for and, in fact, trying to

        develop internally, weren't considered or actually weren't accepted has slowed society's progress




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                     15
        and its emissions reductions and capturing. I think today there's this recognition that we need more

        solutions and that, frankly, the industry can bring those solutions to bear. And at this stage of what is

        going to be a very complicated and expensive transition, we need as many solutions on the table as

        possible, not eliminating any of them. And staying focused on emissions reductions, I think that's

        starting to resonate. And so the challenge here is this is a very nascent – the areas that we're focused

        on – which are the molecule oriented parts of the business that, you know, are very consistent with

        our capabilities and expertise and advantages. We’re in the very early stages, frankly. We're in the

        lead in that space. There aren't any other companies that have secured the kind of third-party

        emission reduction opportunities that we have, there aren't any parties out there that have got the

        scale of the investments that we're progressing. And so I think generally people recognize that we're

        delivering on our ambition to lead the industry, and more than anything else, they’re

        supportive. Obviously there's a desire to make things go faster, and frankly, that's a function of the

        opportunity set. And if you think about the IRA and the role that it plays, that legislation hasn't even

        been translated into regulations yet. And that's going to be a critical step. And I think there are many

        governments around the world who are working on appropriate legislation to incentivize and create

        a market for carbon that hasn't come to be yet. We're very early in this process and there are a

        number of players in here who have a role to deliver. We feel like we're delivering on our part, but

        there are other elements that have to come together for this to be successful. And then, ultimately,

        we're going to need advances in technology to keep driving that cost down so that we can get to

        more and more dilute streams of CO 2. We're doing a lot of work in that space. And frankly, again, I

        think our pipeline of opportunities, our technology pipeline, I feel pretty good about and I hope to, in

        the next several years, commercialize some technologies that further reduce the cost of emissions

        reduction. So I think it’s early, a lot of work going on. I think we're making a lot of good progress. We

        feel good about the role that we're playing and the leadership position that we have.



Roger Read:      Great. Thank you.

Operator:        We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.



Sam Margolin:    Hello. Is that better?



Darren Woods: That is better. That's better. Sam, welcome back.



Sam Margolin: I’m okay. So the question is about EOR as it pertains to Denbury. I think, you know, there's

        some optimism that EOR barrels might be credited with carbon attributes because it buries more

        CO2 than the associated emissions of the oil. And so, you know, maybe that's option value. But I was

        just wondering where you stand on that topic and if it was at all a factor. You know, as you look at

        different asset classes and saw that EOR was available.



Darren Woods: Yeah. So I would say obviously that's the core business today of Denbury and it facilitated the

        infrastructure that they have in place. that, frankly, for us was not a key driver or strategic driver of

        the opportunity. I think EOR, certainly in the short term, can play a role. But if you think about the

        broader opportunity, it's really around carbon capture, storage, and sequestration and keeping the

        carbon under the ground. So that's the longer term play for us. I mean, as I just commented here

        about the challenges with the regulation and the translation of IRA into regulation, you know, we've

        got a class six well permitting that's going to be required for sequestration. That's a fairly slow

        progress to date. So there's a lot of work that has to go into putting these pieces together so that

        we're successful. I see EOR as providing a lot of optionality in the short term that as we're bringing

        on carbon capture facilities, working with third parties, and we start capturing the CO 2, if we don't

        have everything lined up on the sequestration side, the EOR gives us an opportunity to progress

        these things and not lose schedule. So I think right now that's the way I would think about

        it. Certainly, it’s not a strategic thrust for us as a company.

Sam Margolin: Understood. Thank you so much.



Darren Woods: You bet. Thank you.



Operator: We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.



Stephen Richardson: Good morning. I was wondering if we could dig in a little bit on the debottlenecking

        opportunity you talked about in Guyana, clearly the 20% above nameplate or above design is pretty

        significant. Darren, could you drill in a little bit on what you're seeing here? Is it, you know, changes to

        the subsurface? Is it changes in the kit? Is it uptime? Kind of scale that for us and maybe just I mean,

        really significant benefits if you roll it forward on a couple of the other projects that you have in the

        queue. So maybe just talk about how it's changing your view of the future opportunities. Thank you.



Darren Woods: Yeah, sure. And thanks for the question. It's something that, frankly, the organization has

        spent decades working on. I'd bucket it in three distinct buckets. First, it starts with the design and

        build out of the project itself. And so having a projects organization with the capability that we've

        built and strengthened here over the last several years, we end up with facilities that have the right

        design and are built the right way so that we've got a really good platform to optimize and a good

        opportunity to squeeze, to find opportunities to maximize and optimize the production coming out

        of the facilities without compromising any of the design specifications and staying well within safe

        operating envelopes. And we've done that, you know, over the years at a lot of our facilities, and I

        think this project organization even extends that capability with the skills that they bring to the

        project development and the build out. And then I'd say the second bucket is our operations

        organization and the focus that they put on maximizing utilization and production. And I think, you

        know, the mindset in the company is once you've got steel in the ground, you've got this capital, the




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                       18
        operations job is to run it reliably, run it safely, run it in an environmentally responsible way, but at the

        same time, maximize the value of that steel in the ground. And they've done a tremendous job of

        that. And it's, you know, it's not one big thing. It's a lot of little things that the organization stays

        focused on and pushes. And again, we've seen that not only in Guyana, but really all the capital

        projects that we've been bringing on. The organization has done a great job of making sure that

        we're maximizing the value of the capital that we've invested. And then the third bucket, I would say,

        is our technology organization. And again, we've taken the step to consolidate all of our technology

        organizations and move from what was a business oriented construct to a capabilities construct. And

        so we've got, you know, our best people brought together working on our biggest opportunities. It's

        really driving innovation and creativity. And this close partnership that technology now has with the

        business and the shared commitment to drive value leads to more technology getting out in the field

        and assisting the operations group in squeezing it. And so I'd say all those are coming together. My

        expectation is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we're going to see the first two FPSOs

        get above 400,000 barrels a day as we continue to optimize. And we'll do that in a very safe and

        environmentally responsible way. My expectation is when the third boat comes on with Payara, we'll

        see similar levels of improvement there. And frankly, the expectation that we have for ourselves is

        that as we go forward, and continue to build these projects, we will continue to find the same kind of

        benefits and optimization opportunities with the projects. And it comes back to this inherent

        capability that we've built into our businesses.



Stephen Richardson: Thanks so much.



Darren Woods: You bet.



Operator:        We’ll go next to Ryan Todd, with Piper Sandler.




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                        19
Kathryn A. Mikells:   Good morning, Ryan.



Ryan Todd:       Good morning. A question maybe back on the Upstream. Even given the pricing

        environment, I think Upstream performance that we've seen for the quarter, not just for you, but for

        other peers that reported this week, have been a little weaker than expected with much of that

        seemingly driven by the global gas environment. Can you talk about drivers or headwinds that you

        maybe saw during the quarter on pricing relative to headline markers, maybe headwinds in trading or

        any other potential drivers there and how those might evolve over the remainder of this year?



Darren Woods: I'll let Kathy maybe dive into a little more detail. I would just say, with respect to pricing and

        the impact on the business, actually our quarter came in pretty much in line with what we had

        expected. If you looked at the 8-K that we put out and our best attempt to model the impact just

        from the market environment, we are pretty rigorous in making sure that when we put an 8-K out,

        that it's really focused on discrete planned events, but much more importantly on what the market

        impact has been to the business quarter on quarter.



        And so I think that kind of laid out pretty consistently with what we expected. Obviously, gas prices

        were down but I think refining margins are down a bit, but still in very healthy territory. And if you

        look at the fundamentals, quite frankly, as we head into the back half of the year, I think as demand

        picks up, we're going to see the limits that we have on additional supply, I think, come back into the

        mix and see supply-demand tighten up a bit. So my expectation is the back half of the year, we'll see

        some upward pressure just given demand changes and the limited options we have to significantly

        increase supply. But Kathy, anything to add to that?



Kathryn A. Mikells:   Yeah. I'll mention a couple of other things to you. As a result of some of the divestments

        we've done over the past year, if you look at our gas portfolio, we're now about 45% LNG, so a little




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                   20
        bit more tip to LNG if you just look at kind of impact of pricing across our gas portfolio and results. I

        mean, Henry Hub was down about 40%. TTF was down almost 50%. And the last thing I'd say is we

        always talk about the fact that, on LNG, a lot of our contracts are tied to lagged oil prices. And so if

        you just look at where oil prices were in the fourth quarter, kind of relative to where they are more

        currently, I'm going to call them down roughly $10 a barrel. And so that pricing impact would've

        flowed through as well.



        And then the last thing that I will mention associated with our trading results is, if you exclude mark-

        to-market - so if you look in Upstream, mark-to-market was a positive for us in the quarter - but if

        you excluded mark-to-market, I would've then said our gas trading results were a little bit lighter this

        quarter. So kind of all of that packaged together, I think gives you a pretty good understanding of our

        gas results.



Ryan Todd:       Great, thank you.



Operator:        We’ll go next to Jason Gabelman, with TD Cowen.



Jason Gabelman:        Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about another energy transition area that's been

        receiving some attention in the media in terms of Exxon's activity, which is lithium drilling and then

        refining. And it seems like you're wading a bit more into the space. I'm wondering how you view that

        opportunity given your expertise in drilling and refining of materials in the ground and if that

        development in that space was contemplated at all in that $17 billion energy transition budget that

        you previously laid out. Thanks.



Darren Woods: Sure. Yeah. Maybe I'll just come back to kind of the fundamentals of how we think about

        ExxonMobil's participation in the transition space. And it comes back to the focus on leveraging the




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                    21
        advantages that we have as a corporation where we believe we can add unique value. That's why we

        have since the very beginning stayed focused on what I'd say is the molecule side of the equation and

        carbon capture and hydrogen and biofuels. But we're looking at frankly, all the areas that we believe

        we have an expertise and a unique capability and seeing if there's a fit for products or solutions that

        can help society decarbonize.



        Lithium and production of lithium from brine water, if you think about what's required to do that, is

        really an extension of a lot of the current capabilities that we have in our Upstream. It requires a good

        understanding of the subsurface, requires a good understanding of reservoir management, requires

        drilling, and injections. And so I think the below surface things are very much in line with the skills and

        capabilities that we've built out over the decades in our Upstream business.



        The processing of the brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that

        we do in our refineries and chemical plants, and in fact, in some of our upstream operations. So that

        piece of the equation's, again, not new to the company. So as you look at all that I think the

        capability, the skillset that we have, the operating experience that we have all lend themselves to

        that. And then of course there's the question of how does the market fundamentals look and supply

        and demand, and do we see a role for what we're doing there.



        And, frankly, we've been looking at that for quite some time. I'd say we're still early in evaluating the

        opportunity, but we believe that by, again, applying our advantages in this space we can bring on a

        much needed resource - Lithium - one that's predicted to go short. We can bring it on at a much

        lower cost, and, I think importantly, with much less environmental impact versus, say, the open

        mining that they're doing in other parts of the world.




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                      22
        So, this to us, feels like a potential win-win-win opportunity, a win using our capabilities, a win from

        an environmental impact standpoint, and a win in terms of supplying markets with a crucial

        component to electrification and EVs. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it and we're,

        I'd say, actively exploring that opportunity set and like what we're seeing so far.



Jason Gabelman:       Great. That's a really helpful color. Thanks.



Darren Woods: You bet.



Operator:        We’ll go next to Josh Silverstein, with UBS.



Josh Silverstein: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. So the cash balance is still around $30 billion for about

        four quarters now. And Kathy, last quarter you mentioned that you were comfortable holding the

        larger balance because of the net positive spread and interest rates versus your debt cost. That

        spread is still there, so you’re probably not in a rush to do anything, but just wondering if this is still

        the best use of cash versus deploying it into higher rate of return projects or buybacks. And if the

        forward curve holds at the current strip right now, if you foresee Exxon going into a net cash position

        next year, thanks.



Kathryn A. Mikells:   Sure. And so we're pretty happy with our overall balance sheet position right now, and

        I've stated for a couple quarters now that we expect our cash balance is going to ebb and flow a little

        bit just based on how the commodity price environment, and margin environment ebbs and flows.

        So we think it's pretty critical to hang on to a really strong balance sheet because it gives us the

        flexibility that we need through the cycles. If you look overall at what we're doing from an investment

        perspective, I would say we're never trying to constrain the organization in terms of deploying good

        capital investments, and that's across our entire business.




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                      23
        It includes our LCS business. Obviously, the acquisition of Denbury will enable us to accelerate the

        growth of our carbon capture and sequestration business within LCS, and we're excited about that

        opportunity and profitably growing that part of our business. So I think it's really important when we

        talk about capital deployment, that we are not trying to constrain the company from new capital

        projects that can drive good returns for our shareholders.



        And that's how we create, I'd say, the virtuous cycle of how we can then support competitive

        growing dividends that are sustainable over the long term and a more consistent share repurchase

        program. So I'd say we're really happy with our balance sheet. We intend to hang on to a higher cash

        balance than the company has done historically just to give us more flexibility as we think about how

        we manage the company over the long term and through the cycles.



Darren Woods: And just maybe to emphasize the point a third time that Kathy made. The mandate to the

        businesses is find advantage projects that position us ahead of competition and deliver high returns,

        high value. And that's the mandate they've been given and we will fund those opportunities as they

        come forward. I think what you see in terms of what limits the investment is the ability to manifest

        those opportunities.



        And I think it's the challenge that we give our organization to only fund the things that we feel

        confident are robust to very low price environment, are well ahead of other companies, and tap into

        what I would say are the long-term fundamentals of the market. And I think as we find those things,

        and the organization is very focused on developing those opportunities set, we will fund them

        because that's how you generate long-term value for the corporation and our shareholders.



Josh Silverstein: Great. Thanks, guys.

Operator:        We’ll go next to Neal Dingmann, with Truist Securities.



Neil Dingmann: Morning. Thanks for the time. My question is on OFS costs, just your thoughts both

        domestically and internationally for the remainder of the year and in 2024, how you’re thinking about

        either inflation or deflation?



Kathryn A. Mikells:   Yeah. I mean, the way that we’re thinking about inflation and whether it’s oil field

        services costs, or other costs across the business, I’d say we’ve gotten to a point where we’re actually

        starting to see inflation come off in certain cost categories. If you think about some of the chemicals

        that we would use and unconventional things like sand, what we would call tubular goods, which

        would include piping and valves and those types of things, we’re starting to see some deflationary

        pressure now. As it relates to things where labor is a high component of the cost, I would say we’re

        not yet necessarily seeing that deflationary pressure coming through yet.



        But overall, I’d say it’s probably too early to see much of that come through the second half of the

        year. But as we’re looking forward into 2024, I’d say we fundamentally feel like inflation is going to

        come off as we’re looking forward because we’re starting to see those signs across multiple

        categories now throughout the business.



Neil Dingmann: Very helpful. Thank you.



Kathryn A. Mikells:   You are welcome.

Operator:        We’ll go next to Paul Cheng, with Scotiabank.



Paul Cheng:      Hi. Thank you. Good morning, guys.



Darren Woods: Good morning Paul.



Paul Cheng:      Thank you. You previously had set a soft target to spend $17 billion in the low carbon

        business through 2027. Denbury sale, the acquisition is about 30%. And you’re also saying

        that you’re seeing a lot more opportunities. Should we interpret that your 17 billion, that number, will

        be increased perhaps quite substantially?



Darren Woods: Thanks, Paul. I think, as you rightly point out, the Denbury acquisition was not part of the

        $17 billion. Maybe just a little bit of perspective on that. We're just starting that business up, as you

        can imagine, very early in the opportunity set and progressing the opportunities. I think Dan and his

        team in the Low Carbon Solutions business have made tremendous progress in bringing those

        opportunities to bear and manifest in contracts with customers. As we've talked about with the three

        big customers that we now have and demonstrating that we can decarbonize some of these hard-

        to-decarbonize industries that don't have a lot of good alternatives. We've also got a very significant

        investment opportunity in Baytown to bring on the world's largest hydrogen plant, and then we've

        got opportunities for low carbon ammonia associated with that. So think a pretty robust

        portfolio. And with the announcements of the deals that we've got to date, the commercial deals

        that we struck with the announcement of Denbury, I think a lot of recognition and interest by outside

        potential customers that there's a real opportunity here and that ExxonMobil provides a real

        solution. So that's the context I would say the $17 billion that was looking at a portfolio of

        opportunities and in trying to assess how quickly those opportunities would manifest themselves and

        the capital that would be required to do that. We're continuing that work. There's a lot. And so as we




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                    26
        continue to develop and make progress on these projects, some of the capital becomes more

        discrete and we can see it a lot clearer. Other deals move out. And so I'd say right now it's a portfolio

        approach. We're not changing the $17 billion to date. Frankly, the Denbury acquisition, if that goes

        through, will allow us to pull back on some of the grassroots investments that we were making in

        logistics and substitute that with the assets that we've brought in from Denbury. So it's, I'd say, kind

        of an evolving space. I think the thing to stay focused on, we're not going to compromise on our

        return criteria or the advantaged criteria that we're insisting on for the projects that we bring to

        bear. We have to be low cost suppliers in this space. We have to be leveraging the advantages the

        corporation has, and we have to be generating good, competitive returns. And that's going to dictate

        the pace of how quickly that Capex manifests itself and, frankly, the size of it. And as we go through

        this year's plan, I know, Dan and his team's very focused on, based on, you know, having a year under

        their belts, continuing to execute and drive this business and will develop more detailed plans and

        update that number. I don't know if you have anything you want to add for Paul.



Kathy Mikells: Yeah, just the other thing I want to mention is, especially as it relates to the CCS business, you

        know, what you're going to see over time is that we're building a backlog and that backlog is what's

        going to support the future growing Capex kind of over the longer term and the profitable growth of

        that business. So today, I would describe ExxonMobil's backlog as, you know, 5 million tons annually

        supported by three very large industrial customers, one in the industrial gas sector, one in the steel

        sector, one that makes ammonia that that's used for fertilizer. And, you know, if you just think about

        what that does for society, those 5 million tons annually, that translates into the conversion of about

        2 million cars from gas powered vehicles to electric vehicles. That's about all the [electric] cars that

        are on the road in the United States today. And when we talk about the overall CCS opportunity

        across the Gulf Coast, we talk about 100 million tons annually. You know, that's 20 times that

        number. But I'm going to go back to the fact that it will be supported by customer backlog that

        supports a growing profitable business. So that's how you should think about it.

Paul Cheng:      Great. Thank you. Can I sneak in a real quick question?



Kathryn A. Mikells:   Of course.



Paul Cheng:      Yeah. Thank you. Real quick. Darren, do you have a number you can share? What is the

        production for Permian this quarter?



Kathryn A. Mikells:   620 KOEBD.



Paul Cheng:      Thank you.



Darren Woods: You bet. Paul.



Operator:        Looks like we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Paul Sankey

        with Sankey Research.



Paul Sankey:     Hi, good morning everyone. Just a follow-up actually, just looking at your volumes

        upstream. First of all, you mentioned that there was turnarounds and stuff, but I wondered if you

        could talk about the recovery, especially in the light of the stronger Guyana volumes. The fact that

        your Upstream volumes are down quite hard here, is that going to be a rapid recovery in Q3 and

        back towards what kind of levels would we expect for the rest of the year? Thanks.



Darren Woods: Yeah. Sure, Paul. I'll take that. If you think about the first quarter, we were up pretty

        significantly. Second quarter we’re down from that first quarter, but essentially on plan with respect

        to the full year of production levels that we talked about at the back end of last year when we put our




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                  28
        plan forward. And I would tell you that there's nothing that we're seeing today that changes that

        guidance that we gave last year of 3.7 million barrels a day of production.



        And so I'd say we're on track with that. We're not seeing anything that makes us change our mind.

        And obviously, we're working real hard to do better than that. But I would say right now we feel like

        we're on track to meet the plan and meet the numbers that we shared earlier last year.



Paul Sankey:     Can you say more about the downtimes that you had in Q2?



Kathryn A. Mikells:   Yeah, I'll just mention we had given a bit of guidance to divestment and schedule

        downtime and that guidance was that we thought we'd see a reduction of about 110 KOEBD. If I

        said what the actuals were across both of those items, it was actually 120 and that's a sequential

        number. So we were down sequentially 120 KOEBD as a result of divestments and the scheduled

        downtime. If you then just look at why our overall production down a little bit more than that, it was

        really driven by two things.



        So we've seen curtailments and obviously OPEC is cutting production, and so we have an impact

        coming from that. And then in terms of unscheduled downtime, we had a short strike in Nigeria that

        tipped up our unscheduled downtime. But again, I would go back to what Darren said. We had

        guided for the full year at about 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels a day. And if you looked at our year

        to date numbers, we're up about 15,000 on a year-to-date basis, year-over-year.



Paul Sankey:     That's super helpful. And just to follow up, if I look at your energy product sales, those are up

        just about as much, if not more positively. Obviously, that's mostly Beaumont I guess, but is there

        anything else to add there to the strength?




Excerpt from ExxonMobil 2Q23 Earnings Call                                                                     29
Kathryn A. Mikells:   Yeah. No, Beaumont is the main thing. And then we obviously had a bit less

        maintenance kind of going on, which helped our volumes as well. I'd mentioned that Beaumont was

        running at 90% utilization. So again, a really nice, I think proof point and just the operational

        excellence across the company.



Paul Sankey:     Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.



Darren Woods: Thank you, Paul.
