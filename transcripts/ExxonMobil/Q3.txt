weve gotten around transaction folks looking little clarity topline synergies going come better productivity neil chapman good morning neil outlined slides earnings release really basis always describe real quantifiable synergies created deal space transaction synergies already demonstrated existing operations either delaware midland include pipeline new technologies either early stages deployment close deployment applying weve already demonstrated confident recover additional billion oilequivalent barrels either pioneer industry could demonstrated existing performance charts highlight two areas one industry moved cube development theyve moved cube development get higher net present value pioneer thats obviously avoid parentchild impact top chart shows weve drilling cubes since midland see period pioneer moved cubes well developing cubes see weve got equivalent recovery rates excerpt exxonmobil q earnings call notably lowerquality acreage lowerquality resource equivalent recovery lowerquality resource looked truly comparable acreage thats really really important generalizations lead misleading results bottom talk adjacent martin county us pioneer one peers drilling lateral cubes see get higher recovery thats targeting targeting interval middle spraberry wolfcamp c similar proportions varies whats difference stacking landing zones varies optimal well spacing delivering includes things like vertical orientation one final point neil terms recovery deliver cubes youve got better recovery youve got better capital efficiency gives access economically developing would describe secondary benches recall like wolfcamp c like jo mill extension addition obviously techniques attempt keep confidential gives us higher level recovery neil mehta thank neil operator next question comes bob brackett bernstein research please go ahead bob brackett good morning talk millionbarrel day initial sort view production combined entity get think gating factor excerpt exxonmobil q earnings call fixed rig activity capex program volume outcome volume target youll adjust activity synergies come neil chapman yes bob neil want clear dont volume target value target volume outcome thats really really important basins weve talked outcome million barrels day end based delaware midland basin based initial assessments pioneers plans obviously weve access due diligence process see similar capital spending pioneer today equate similar number rigs would anticipate pioneers production exxonmobil pioneers combined operations would also get million barrels day end add current production midland basin pioneer exxonmobil today already million barrels today really important though volume outcome driving value thats focus cube development would say basis

proved prolific original targets area could look double resource potential time announced potentially significantly larger havent updated resource number youve lancetfish looks like fangtooth queue based eis submissions guyana yet still talk production capacity production question capability obviously keeping boats full extended period time ultimately see production capacity sorry actual production opposed capacity trajectory end decade point excerpt exxonmobil q earnings call neil chapman yes thanks doug mean theres probably parts question one exploration one production capacity let handle exploration first weve youre aware three discoveries year including lancetfish recent one continue integrate results exploration appraisal drilling going update resource base see significant change program exploration appraisal continues way like frame southeast corner stabroek block continuing appraise around discoveries take lot work lot activity six drill ships basin theyre theyre development appraisal exploration drilling addition appraisal drilling southeast part block looking would describe anchor prospects north west continue look probably got order magnitude three call true wildcats exploration targets looking anchor wells next months something like change based results either appraisal exploration drilling going update see something meaningful see something significant weve clear six fpsos pipeline firm ive one previous questions outlined indeed capacity strive keep full time know doug one beauties stabroek block density resource proximity boats gives potential tiebacks well future water cut increase everybody knows deepwater excerpt exxonmobil q earnings call constantly look like talk capacity optimize go increase production versus nameplate capacity go thats think firm six boats end nameplate capacity obviously strive keep full liquids oil period mean think get closer obviously well update numbers doug doug leggate appreciate full answer neil thanks much neil chapman yeah sure thanks operator next question stephen richardson evercore isi line open please go ahead stephen richardson great thank going keep neil busy morning another one
