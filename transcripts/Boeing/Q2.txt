David L. Calhoun
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

Thank you, Matt. Welcome, everyone. As usual, I'm going to make a few comments upfront with respect to the
quarter.
The quarter was solid, very solid for all of our businesses. We continue to make steady progress on our recovery.
We do have challenges. The supply chain notably is the most significant, but it's steadily getting better. Overall,
we feel good about our operational and financial outlook including the free cash flow and delivery ranges that we
set for 2023, as well as for that 2025 and 2026 timeframe.
We're particularly encouraged by generating $2.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow is the best
metric that we have to measure progress against this recovery. We had a very strong second quarter and we're
confident in the $3 billion to $5 billion target for the year.
I'd like to highlight a couple of updates around the business. Commercial Airplanes had a very solid quarter.
Demand remains high. We booked 460 net orders in the second quarter and we're proud to announce – or firm-up
key orders I should say, 220 for Air India and we secured our commitment for up to 300 with Ryanair.

Broadly, demand is strong and resilient. The need for 42,000 airplanes over the next 20 years is what the industry
is telling us and with demand strong, the supply side of the system is beginning to settle down. Our focus remains
on execution and driving stability in the production and the supply chain and we're making steady progress.
We delivered 136 commercial airplanes in the quarter, including 103 737s and 20 787s. Given the progress
through the first half of the year, we are on the right path to reach our 737 and 787 delivery guidance for the year
and we're steadily increasing our rate on each program with focus on stability every step of the way.
With respect to the Spirit quality escapes, the work stoppage and the bridge impairment, all have been contained
and will be remedied as we exit the third quarter. So it will cost us a few deliveries in the quarter itself. We're also
progressing across our key development programs: the 737-7, the 737-10, the 777X and the 777-8F.
This quarter is a solid proof point. We're beginning to stabilize our operations and are on the right path and the
financial results speak for them self. I'd also like to recognize our team and our customers on the 737 MAX return
to service. As of this month, the fleet has flown more than 5 million flight hours and over 2 million flights since
returning to service, all with exceptional reliability.
The return to service in China is now largely complete as well with more than 90% of the 737 MAX aircraft back in
service. More broadly in China, we're encouraged by recent signs of progress. It's an important market for us.
We're committed to our customers there and we'll be ready to deliver when that time comes.
Boeing Defense. In Defense and Space we still have more work to improve operating performance, but the
portfolio is well-positioned and we're making progress. Results impacted by continuing losses on three fixed-price
development programs, Commercial Crew, the T-7A and the MQ-25 have hit us in the quarter.
On Starliner, we're in lockstep with our customer. We've prioritized safety and we're taking whatever time is
required. We're confident in that team and committed to getting it right. On MQ-25, scheduled pressure added
cost to the program, but we've had some recent successes that give us confidence that we're heading in the right
direction. We're approximately 25% of the way through the build of our first MQ-25. The static test article fuselage
is complete, with preparation underway for the start of static testing this quarter.
And on the T-7A, the impact was not due to any performance challenge within the quarter and was more
associated with our estimates for higher supply chain and production costs in the future, similar to what many in
the industry are facing. Even with the cost growth, we're hitting some key milestones on the program.
The Air Force successfully completed its first flight of the T-7. We're heading toward the start of a flight test in
earnest. We're looking at the program – if you look at the program, from award to this moment, we've had some
very important successes. We moved from firm concept to early flight testing in just 36 months on this program
and a combination of model-based engineering, 3D design, and our advanced manufacturing increased first-time
quality by 75% and reduced our assembly hours by 80%.
We're also making progress on other key BDS programs. On the Tanker, for example, we have now completed
rework on the production aircraft acquiring it and we have resumed deliveries to the Air Force. As we move
through each quarter, we're progressing through these contracts and getting closer to putting them in the rearview
mirror. Despite the challenges, we're hitting some important milestones that increase our confidence. Most
importantly, these programs will meet or beat the high-performance standards of the war fighter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call

26-Jul-2023

Given the fixed-price nature of some of our contracts, we're very transparent about these financial impacts and
we're working to stabilize, to derisk and mature them through development. Quarterly charges have declined
significantly over the last 18-months. Demand side of BDS is strong. We see solid order activity. In the quarter we
booked orders valued at $6 billion including key contracts from the US Army for 19 Chinooks, and Germany also
shared its plans to purchase 60 Chinooks. We remain confident in our Defense business. Demand is strong and
we will continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels.
Boeing Global Services. Another very strong quarter both on the commercial and government side of BGS.
Healthy revenue and expanding earnings and margin. We're really proud of this team. They've had solid steady
performance and they've enabled both commercial and military customers to keep fleets flying through a very
dynamic time. Some of our highlights this quarter include the expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution
site, Japan Airlines adopting Boeing Insight Accelerator, our digital predictive maintenance solution for the 787
fleet.
To wrap-up my comments, we've had no shortage of challenges pop-up to the start of this year and we knew that
would be the case. We've had conformance items that we've identified or external challenges within the supply
chain, even logistic routes including washed out bridges. This is a complex business. We expect items to come up
and when they do, we're transparent. We take action and we move forward. This is what progress looks like.
We're proud of the team.
We are well-positioned for the year and for the long-term. Relative to the strong demand, we will remain in a
supply-constrained world for the foreseeable future.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance.
Second quarter revenue was $19.8 billion, that's up 18% year-over-year. The growth was primarily driven by
higher commercial volume including increased 787 deliveries.
Core operating margin in the quarter was minus 2% and the core loss per-share was $0.82. Margins and EPS
were driven by expected abnormal costs and period expenses, as well as losses on three fixed-price development
programs in our Defense business, which I'll cover later.
Free cash flow, as Dave mentioned, was positive $2.6 billion in the quarter, significantly better versus last year
and last quarter, driven by higher commercial deliveries and favorable receipt timing. Relative to our expectations
shared at the last earnings call, the strong order activity in the quarter drove over $2 billion of favorable advanced
payment timing. Keep in mind, most of this was expected to occur in the third quarter.
Turning to the next page, I'll cover Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 460 net orders in the quarter, including
220 with Air India, 39 with Riyadh Air and signed a Purchase Agreement with Ryanair for up to 300 737 MAX-10s.
We now have over 4,800 airplanes in backlog valued at $363 billion.
Revenue was $8.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year on 136 airplane deliveries driven by the 787 program.
Operating margin was minus 4.3%, a sequential improvement versus the first quarter as anticipated, but remains

negative as we continue to be impacted by expected abnormal costs and period expenses including higher R&D
spending.
As Dave noted, we worked through a number of operational challenges so far this year. We're making steady
progress and will continue to focus on stability as we look to increase production on key programs.
On the Spirit work stoppage, we were pleased to see a quick resolution and we will work through any limited
impacts to production. Overall, this is not expected to change our production and delivery outlook.
On to the programs. On the 737, we had 103 deliveries in the quarter, including 49 in June, a positive proof point
that the production system is stabilizing.
In regards to the Spirit fitting issue that we discussed last quarter, in May we resumed deliveries of reworked
airplanes and also began producing newly-built airplanes meeting our specifications. In light of this progress, we
are now transitioning production to 38 per month and still plan to increase to 50 per month in the 2025-2026
timeframe. As we move to the higher-rate, we'll continue to prioritize stability and it will take some time to
consistently deliver at 38 per month off the line. We still project full-year 737 deliveries of 400 to 450 with
sequential improvement in the second-half.
We ended the quarter with approximately 220 MAX airplanes in inventory. This includes 85 for customers in China,
and 55 that have now been remarketed as part of the plan we previously discussed. We still expect most MAX
inventory airplanes to be delivered by the end of 2024.
Moving on to the 787 program. We had 20 deliveries in the quarter and still expect between 70 and 80 deliveries
this year. We increased production to four per month during the quarter and still plan to reach five per month by
year-end. We ended the quarter with 85 airplanes in inventory and rework is progressing nicely and we still expect
most to be delivered by the end of 2024. We booked $314 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, in-line with
expectations, and there's no change to the total estimate of $2.8 billion which is largely done by year-end.
Finally, on the 777X program, efforts are ongoing and the program timeline is unchanged. Abnormal costs were
$136 million as expected and we've lowered our total estimate from $1.5 billion to $1 billion, which reflects plans to
resume production later this year, rather than early 2024.
Moving on to the next page, and Defense and Space. BDS booked $6 billion in orders in the quarter, including an
award from the U.S. Army for 19 CH-47 Chinooks and the backlog is now at $58 billion. Revenue was flat at $6.2
billion, and we delivered 38 aircraft in the quarter. Operating margin was minus 8.5%, primarily driven by three
fixed-price development programs.
The first was related to Commercial Crew, tied to scheduled delays that we previously shared and had a $257million impact. The second on MQ-25 related to a schedule shift that drove a $68-million impact. And lastly on the
T-7A production contract, we revised the long-term production cost estimates that will occur over several years,
starting in the 2025 timeframe, which drove an impact of $189 million. These determinations were mostly made
over the last few weeks as we closed out the quarter.
Similar to last quarter, roughly 60% of the portfolio is generating solid levels of performance, in line with historical
margins. But we continue to see operational impacts from labor and stability and supply chain disruption on other
programs that contributed to lower margins.

Looking at BDS in aggregate, it will take time to return to normalized levels of performance. We're confident and
we're focused on the path to high single-digit margins in 2025-2026. A strong demand across the customer base,
the portfolio is well positioned, and we're focused on execution.
Moving on to the next page, let's cover Services. BGS had another very strong quarter. BGS received $4 billion in
orders during the quarter and the backlog is $18 billion. Revenue was $4.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year,
primarily driven by favorable volume and mix in both Commercial and Government Services. Operating margin
was 18%, an expansion of 110 basis points versus last year, with both our Commercial and Government
businesses delivering double-digit margins. Operating margins in the quarter were higher than expected due to
favorable mix, which we don't expect to continue at these levels.
In the quarter, BGS announced an expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, a collaboration with
CAE, and the Japan Airlines has adopted the Boeing Insight Accelerator for the 787 fleet.
Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of cash and marketable
securities and our debt balance decreased to $52.3 billion. In the quarter, we repaid $3.4 billion of maturing debt
and provided a $180-million cash advance to Spirit as previously shared. Year-to-date we've repaid $5.1 billion of
debt which is essentially all of our maturities for the year. We also maintained $12 billion revolving credit facilities
at the end of the quarter, all of which remain undrawn.
Our liquidity position is strong. The Investment-grade credit rating continues to be important and we're deploying
capital in-line with the priorities we've shared. Invest in the business and pay down debt through strong cash flow
generation.
And flipping to the last page, I'll cover our outlook. The 2023 overall financial outlook is unchanged from what
we've previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation. The operating cash makeup
by division will likely be different, with BCA and BGS better than expected, and BDS lower than expected due to
the lower operating performance. Net-net, we still have confidence in the $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow
for the year.
Stepping back to address the state of the market. Commercial demand remained strong across our key programs
and services. Cargo remains healthy. Global passenger traffic was up 39% in May, and is at 96% of prepandemic levels. 105% domestic and 91% international.
China, pass-through traffic in May was at 87% of pre-pandemic levels with domestic traffic up more than 300%
year-on-year and above pre-pandemic levels. Defense demand is also robust and the FY 2024 budget continues
to progress in line with our expectations. Our portfolio and capabilities are well-positioned to support the needs of
the nation and of our allies. With demand strong, we still find ourselves in a supply-constrained environment and
our focus continues to be on execution, both within our factories and the supply chain as we steadily increase
production.
Relative to the first half of 2023, we continue to expect operating and financial performance to improve in the
second half. On the third quarter specifically, we expect BCA margins to improve sequentially, but remain
negative and we're not anticipating much in terms of BDS profitability. The 2Q effective tax rate of 63% included
cumulative adjustments related to the projected valuation allowance. These adjustments will continue to weigh on
the tax rate for the remainder of the year. And given the strong results in 2Q cash flow, 3Q will be lower
sequentially, still positive, and likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call

26-Jul-2023

All things considered, we feel good about where we're at on the road to recovery. Right now, we're squarely
focused on meaningful operating performance improvement including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow,
all of which will improve as we progress through 2023 and while the challenges remain, we're headed in the right
direction.
Ultimately, we expect our operational and financial performance to continue to accelerate, align with the plan we
laid out at our IR Day last November, and we are confident in $10 billion of free cash flow in 2025-2026.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for some final remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

Again, a solid quarter. We are wrestling our way through the BDS contract, fixed price contract exposures that we
have. We're confident we will see them through, and as I've said before, most importantly, the products that we
deliver to the war fighter will perform as or better than expected.
So, with that, I'll open it up to questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit
yourself to one single-part question. And our first question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please
go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Sheila Kahyaoglu
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Q

Thank you. Morning, Dave, Brian and Matt. So just digging into Commercial Airplanes' operating loss of $383
million in the quarter, how do we think about this turning positive? Can you maybe talk about the biggest drivers
thinking about production rates stabilizing and then going up what that does to operating margins, and how do
you think about finalizing abnormal cost concessions, and just pricing playing into the mix?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

A

Yeah, hi, Sheila. I'll start off with that. You know, last quarter – first quarter I should say, BCA margins were
negative 9% and we knew that they were going to get sequentially better and they did. They got down to negative
4%, so it's good progress. In terms of where we're headed, as we think about the back-half of the year, we will still
have some negativity, although sequentially better, in the third quarter, and then as we exit the year and moving
over into the first quarter of next year, those margins will move positive. We're confident in that.
And some of the things – the ones you mentioned, which is rate ramp, you'll have some of this abnormal behind
us in the rearview mirror and we'll be done. And of course, the pricing environment is pretty good, so, all of that
give us confidence that we will get these margins positive and it will likely be towards the end of the year, early
next year, and the team is laser-like focused on meeting those expectations.

Peter J. Arment

Q

Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.

Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Dave and Brian. Hey Brian, on staying on that same line of questioning on
MAX profitability, maybe you could just walk us through how we think about cash profitability will improve
with these scheduled rate breaks. Do we need to hit like, a higher rate of 42 a month before we see
meaningful improvement there, or is it more about once the liquidations are complete, in 2024? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West

A

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

Well, it's both. Certainly, the liquidation benefit is something we're very focused on, because when you get rid of
both on the 737 and the 787, those dual factories, it's just going to be a huge relief for the business to put that
behind us, and we're tracking, and we're going to make good progress and that will be substantially behind us as
we move out of 2024. So, that no doubt is a very big deal, coupled with the rate breaks.
We just announced going to 38 airplanes. That's a big important move, and there will be subsequent rate breaks
beyond that, and all of that is going to play into a margin trajectory that's going to start to look a lot more normal
and by the time we get through 2024, and we're focused on that 2025-2026 timeframe, as we've said, BCA
margins will look a lot like they did before in that low double-digit area. So, we know what we have to go do. The
levers are clear. We just got to execute.

Q

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Thanks. One clarification and one question. So, I think, Brian you said that you expected second-half
improvement in 737 deliveries, so are you implying that we're going to now be at the top-end of the delivery range
for the 737? And then I was intrigued by the 777X pull-forward resuming production there. Dave, was there
something on the regulatory front in terms of progress that's helping you pull-forward that schedule at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

No, I wouldn't say anything has changed. We're still confident in the regulatory process. This is our desire to
simply get ahead of the production curve. There's no – yeah, no breaks on the regulatory side. We still have
margin in that and hopefully, we can beat it, but all the projections we've given you I think are still intact.

Brian J. West

A

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

Hey Myles, the answer to the 737 forecast and did we get to the high-end, we – of course we did 103 deliveries in
the second quarter and the quarterly rates will be higher than 103, as our expectation. Of course, we had a little
bit of the Spirit impact in there. That's why that will get sequentially better. And in terms of the rate itself, we
squarely see the middle of that range as high confidence and the question's going to be, how much can we move
from the middle of the range up to the higher end, and we'll prove that out, day in and day out, as we execute and
build more airplanes.
So, we feel very good about the range and we'll keep reporting as we see the execution, but right now, a degree
of confidence in that front.

Jason Gursky
Analyst, Citi

Q

Good morning, everybody. Hey, Brian, one just bookkeeping question and then one question on Defense
margins. On the more bookkeeping one, the Services businesses, you know, posting some pretty good margins
here and you're noting mix. So just wondering when you – if you could just talk a little bit about when you're going
to go back to more normalized margins in that business based on what you're seeing in your inventory mix there?
And then on the Defense, you've historically talked about 60% doing pretty well, 15% these development
programs and then 25% some legacy programs. That's how you've talked about the margins in that business.
Can you confirm that 60%, 15%, 25% is still the right mix of things, and then kind of what's based – or what's in
your assumptions on getting back to that high-single-digit rate, that 2025-2026 timeframe in those three buckets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

A

Sure. So let's take Services. Yeah, they just had an excellent quarter and both Commercial and the Government
businesses were performing incredibly well. We still have high expectations of that business, and we want them to
be doing margins that are in the teens. Will it be 18% quarter-in quarter-out? No. It'll come back a little bit. But
when I say come back a little bit, we still feel like our long-term view of that business should be in the mid-teens,
and from time-to-time, it'll be a little better and we'll keep pushing the business to be just as good as they can be,
but I don't expect it to step back dramatically. We feel really good about where that business is positioned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

A

I'll just comment on that. It's just important to note that they are still in an extremely supply-constrained world.
Everything they do is supply-constrained. So, pricing is a little favorable. Anything that they can get out of their
shops are being taken. That has not changed, and so, how long that lasts, my prediction is it's going to be quite a
while. I don't see any let-up with respect to the need for lift out there and everybody's fighting for the next part, so
I think that's just the moment we're in.

Brian J. West

A

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

And in regards to the Defense business, you've got the pieces correct. The way we think about the fixed-price
development programs that we've talked about at the 15%, we just have to stabilize those and execute and know
that every quarter we're getting closer to having those products over and delivered and behind us. The next piece
of the 60%, very stable, there's a lot of very nice products in there and we have to keep them stable, and with lean
efforts and other things, we actually could get a little bit of productivity out of those programs to get better and
better and better. But that's – keep that 60% stable and keep it moving.
And it's the 25% that's left over. That's the part of the portfolio. It's a handful of programs and they are not where
they need to be. They are negative. They need to swing positive and there's a plan to go do that, but it's just going
to take us a little bit of time.
In terms of what this portfolio looks like in the 2025-2026 timeframe, we believe the 15% will be stable. We'll be at
certain milestones where a lot of the stuff will be in the rearview mirror. And the 85% that's left over is going to be
performing very attractive margins because we've done the hard work of stabilizing and then trying to bring in
even more productivity programs, including lean manufacturing, so that these businesses can get even healthier
and stronger.
So, the roadmap is clear. It's on us to execute it, but we think we've got all the levers working and the team is very
motivated and laser-like focused.

Cai von Rumohr
Analyst, TD Cowen

Q

Yes, thank you very much for taking the call. So, basically to follow up on Jason's question, if we take out the loss
programs, BDS still was marginally red and if we take the 60% that should be earning, they should be earning
$300 million. So, is the 25% losing $300 million? That's the one I really don't understand. How bad is that and if
you say you're going to have modest profits in the third quarter, I mean, again, it looks like there's fairly significant
underperformance there. Maybe give us a little more color on the programs involved and what it takes to get them
back. Thanks so much.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

A

Yeah, sure, Cai. So, we're not going to have modest profitability in the quarter. I think we said that we're not
expecting much at all from the BDS portfolio just to be clear because these things aren't going to solve
themselves in the near-term. Yes, it's a significant gap. It's a hundreds of millions of dollars of swing that we have
to go execute to get these handful of programs in a better spot, and they are complicated situations with
complicated products and factories that almost went dark during the pandemic, and we had to bring them back to
life, and that takes time because one is to get them up and moving and then also to get the right labor that's
trained and knows how to do some very complicated work.

So, we know what the programs are and how we got to go attack them. It just takes a little bit time and a little bit
longer than anyone expected, but we will make progress and we'll work our way through it because we know how
to make these programs and these products as we've been doing it for a while.

Cai von Rumohr

Q

Analyst, TD Cowen

Is there a – is part of the problem that you got stuck with contracts, those are mostly fixed-price contracts and with
inflation and all this disruption, that's the problem and if so, do any of those contracts reach their end so that you
can basically get better pricing going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

Yeah, let me just comment on that. Not really. So, we're going to have to live within this envelope with respect to
pricing and contracts. We might get some ups here and there and modifications here and there, but I wouldn't say
that's the answer to this. The answer is really to get a line that started from zero, because it was more or less
dark, as Brian said, and get it up to pace. A couple of these products are – they're not the same old product.
There's actually a lot of new, I'll call it, capabilities embedded in these products. You can imagine what those are.
I can't talk about them on the call, and so we're just working our way through learning curves.
If we didn't see progress on those learning curves, we wouldn't be giving you the guidance that we're going to be
back to where we were. We do see progress. It's not an act we haven't seen before. It does take time. Frustrating
for everybody, but we're getting there.

Q

Dave, you've been really clear on no new airplane right now, but at the same time, you've talked about and
Boeing is working on the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing aircraft which seems to be a pretty exciting design for the
narrow-body market. And while I know it's early in that process, do you think it has a chance to enter service with
current-gen engines like the LEAP or the GTF and then maybe later take on a CFM RISE?

And then as a second part to this question, could this aircraft actually service the large narrow-body market as
well? Something against the 321.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

I'm glad to get the question. We're heavily invested in this. We like what it could potentially deliver to this market,
a level of performance that the industry is used to seeing with brand new programs. So, now, for me to pick and
choose the variations and the powerplants at this stage is probably not smart. Suffice to say, we are intent on
proving this technology. We are hopeful and if it matures the way we think it will and that NASA frankly thinks it
will, I do think it'll see service. And then those powerplant decisions will be exciting.
You are right. We can use existing power, but we would prefer frankly to have a bigger fan diameter ultimately,
and maybe even open rotor someday. So, those are all considerations without a doubt. I don't want to make
choices too early, but all of those options that you're talking about are still out there. We just have to prove and
mature the technology. If it behaves like it did in the wind tunnel, we're in a pretty good place.

26-Jul-2023

Brian J. West

A

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

Yeah, Kristine. We're there, and we're confident that the supply chains coordinated to deliver on this. They've
known about it for a while and we're happy to be able to move forward. So, we feel very confident.
In terms of subsequent step-ups, the master schedule that's been out there is clear on what those look like, and
we'll do it a step at a time and we're happy we can make this first move to 38.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

Most of our time and applied effort with respect to the supply chain is focused on readiness for the 50 deliveries.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Kristine Tan Liwag

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Great. And then you guys had mentioned that after 38, it would be 42 deliveries, after you've seen some stability.
That stability, I mean what are you guys looking for? Is it a few months of 38? Is it 6 months of 38? And what do
you have to see to get you confident to move over to the next step-up of 42 per month?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

Yeah, it is – as you suggest, 38 deliveries has to come and has to come in a stable form so that we're not up and
down every month, but maybe more important than that, we now have such good visibility into the supply chain.
We know whether they're ready for the next – for 40, 42, 44, et cetera. So, I just think it's the combination of much
better visibility on each of those step-ups, and yes, our own factories assembling and delivering at a steady pace.
But, you'll see all that just like we do.

Great. Thank you. Dave, on 787, it looks like deliveries are off to a slow start here in July. I know you've reiterated

Yeah, there's no new issue on the 787. Let's be very clear. There might have been a tick up in the stringer a few
weeks ago, but we are very focused on both the joint verification work on the 787, and then getting to stable at
four, and then work our way to five. So, 787 we feel particularly good about and we're very confident in that 70 to
80 deliveries for this year.

Okay. Great. Quick follow-up. Probably for Brian. So the BCA forecast, the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion operating
cash flow this year, you've got an up arrow there, so what is surprising to the upside? I mean, you're still running
through big unit losses. Is it just upside from working capital, advances coming in sooner than expected or betterthan-expected? Is that the upside in terms of what that up arrow signifies?

And you've got the new line that should be finished in Everett next year some time. Can you talk about how you
think about that line? Where you could potentially go on rate and how you deal with potential new orders coming
in when kind of the skyline you've got laid out here is – probably pushes you out to like 2028 or so, and the ability
to take an order.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call

26-Jul-2023

Yeah, Doug, why don't I take this. You're right. I guess the truth is I think both us and our competitor face that
circumstance of having to take orders now quite a ways out there. I would love to get to 60 deliveries and the
market is there for it. There's no doubt about it. For me, there's a moment in time that is really important with
respect to execution and the subject of stability and that is second-half of next year when we wind down all of our
shadow factory efforts, and we can apply all of the labor to those rate increases. So, we already have the labor inhouse but now we get them to work on new airplanes and that's a very good thing and you know the economics
attached to that.
It's just not a simple thing to do and I don't want any of us to get ahead of ourselves on this front. So, we're just
going to stay focused, we're going to work hard on stability. Second-half of 2024 is a very important moment in
time because I believe that's the step change for BCA in pretty much every way and if we get through that well
and we execute well, then we'll be talking to all of you about 60 deliveries. But I don't want to get ahead of myself
on one, and either does the team.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Douglas S. Harned

Q

Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC

But, in principle you can do the 50 out of Renton on your current three lines. So, how are you thinking about there
would be some more logistical complexity presumably doing one line in Everett. How would you use that even if
you aren't up at 60 yet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

Again, I'm – having a little too much capacity is not a problem for us right now when you're trying to knock down
stability. So, if we run something at a sub-optimal level, it's not going to cost us much and it's going to improve
stability and delivery and all those things. So, again, I don't – I want to be careful. I don't want to get out that far
and talk about trades at that moment, but right now, we're just focused on stability. We want to have more
capacity than we need so that we're ready for that next increment, and that workforce transition is probably the
most important part of all of it.

Q

Good morning. Thanks very much. Brian, I wanted to ask about the 787 and kind of you talked about some
confidence in the pace of the production ramps and deliveries there. First, any particular items to watch in the
supply chain? And second, if you could start to help us think a little bit about deliveries next year, because if
you're building 60 or 70 planes, and you're supposed to deliver most of the remaining inventory, it suggests
potential for a pretty big delivery haul next year. So, both in terms of A, what is the potential for that to make sure
that we understand what it is; and also so we don't get overly exuberant about what it might be.

26-Jul-2023

Well, I will – I'll be less than satisfying for you because I just can't – I really can't talk about next year delivery
numbers and it's just not the right time to do that, although we still have confidence as we get out of the first half
of this year, the second-half will be better and then we'll just want to make sure we're always sequentially
improving.
As it pertains to the 787, very proud of that team, given where they've been over the last couple years. They've
got the joint verification work, very steady, consistent. They're working on their share of escapes that they
knocked out as fast as they see them, and they're getting to production rates that are steady, and they are getting
to that five per month by the end of the year is a big deal, and no longer are they in the abnormal category. They
are back to where – a path where we expect them, and then there will be obviously increases from there to get to
the 10 by 2025-2026.
So, there's nothing in particular right now that is a major worry bead for 787 and the supply chain still feels like it's
getting better. A little more stable, a little more coordinated and we got to keep executing.

with our customers in China. The return to service work in China, with respect to the airplanes that were already
there is largely complete. Everybody's very happy with the performance. In fact, the reliability of the fleet has been
fantastic and we're getting a lot of good signs that they'll resume delivery, but I'm not going to predict that for you.
We're just going to keep managing it exactly the way we have been. We are not dependent on it. We want to do it,
and we certainly want to support our customers in China, and we will be the free-trade beacon with respect to our
administration and all the political influences. But I'm just going to leave it postured just the way it has been. Know

David L. Calhoun

You know, honestly, I've probably been curt – and maybe too curt with my answers, but I really don't think about
it. I don't view it as a meaningful competitor. There's nothing that I would want to do on the product development
front to respond to it. It's not the world that we're interested. We like our portfolio. The next airplane, in my view,
with respect to development, has to be a meaningful change, 25%, 30% better than what flies today. That's why
we're focused on Transonic – that is, that's just our game plan and I don't think – based on all the competitions
that we've touched, and all the speculation that we hear, I just don't think it's going to be a meaningful difference.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call

26-Jul-2023

Noah Poponak

Q

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Maybe just a few, since I'm last, follow-ups or things that haven't been asked. The leadership of the company had
been out around the Airshow talking about the MAX maybe getting to 42 deliveries a month by the end of the
year. I mean, is that the official plan, or can you talk about that? Pricing, the checks that we have access to are
saying that new aircraft pricing is up a double-digit percentage compared to pre-pandemic. Is that what you're
seeing? And then in the defense margin, next year, with the way you see the milestones laying out and the
progress on the costs that you're going after, can you have some reasonable low- to mid-single-digit margin in the
Defense business next year, or is that 2025 plan more back-end loaded?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Brian J. West

A

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President-Finance, The Boeing Co.

So, I'll take the last one. Our Defense margins have to get better next year, period, full stop. I won't guess in terms
of at what level, but they got to get better as we go on the trajectory to that 2025-2026 timeframe.
And as it pertains to that 42 number, we're talking about 38 today and happy to talk about 38. There's a master
schedule that the supply chain has and they know all those rate breaks, and we'll talk about that more specifically
when we want to move to it, but there's no confusion about where the next rate breaks are. We just want to
focused on one, the 38, and then as Dave mentioned, the preparation for the entire supply chain to get to a
number of 50 deliveries in that 2025-2026 timeframe as Dave mentioned.
That's where most of the focus is. All those interim breaks will be what they are, and we'll get excited to get to
them, as we have stability from one point to another.

David L. Calhoun

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David L. Calhoun
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.

A

Yeah, I can't – I'm not going to give you any specific numbers. Let me just say that the industry is short of
airplanes by a reasonably large margin. Boy, do we compete, I'll tell you that, for every one of these orders,
because they're big and they're important. But, as you might expect in a constrained market, things probably get
better.
