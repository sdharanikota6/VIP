line qa question answer section operator thank please stand first question comes john mcdonald autonomous research may proceed q john mcdonald analyst autonomous research hi good morning jeremy wondering could give us little color youre seeing far deposit reprice migration whats better expected far front see higherforlonger rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure thanks john think themes pretty much weve seen prior quarters talked little bit press call weve trying little bit cautious recognizing dont think current levels sustainable think well reprice pockets degree maybe tiering whatever point future course hasnt happened yet year thats one factor meantime cd strategy working well getting continue get good feedback field capturing money motion seeing sort internal migration associated slow increase deposit rate paid result cd migration thats sort working would hoped everything kind playing according plan would say terms higherforlonger think means continue upward pressure deposit pricing internal migration possibly moderate effects end always say going price products function competitive market environment q john mcdonald analyst autonomous research follow seems like youve done securities repositioning last couple quarters positioning balance sheet terms cash securities portfolio given outlook rates jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah think would say predicting higher rates dont know jamie something say believe prepared thats position time course thats produced good results continue try position neither significantly higher rates significant lower rates present particularly large challenge company probably margin still little bit biased slightly higher rates keep mind modeling duration balance sheet higher rates extend duration rather shorten duration deposit side factor well q john mcdonald analyst autonomous research okay thanks operator thank next question comes steven chubak wolfe research may proceed q steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey steve q steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc hi jeremy hoping inquire capital markets outlook cited improved activity levels september given persistently higher rates geopolitical tensions poor performance recent ipos thinking outlook near medium term thinking timing inflection activity jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question mean know obviously current levels investment banking remain quite depressed certainly relative elevated levels saw pandemic even relative sort might consider last normal year eventually think well recover levels hopefully recover levels recognizing time happens many years economic growth meantime fair current environment little bit complicated mixed headwinds pointed things improved little bit think would say banking team little bit optimistic last quarter feels like little bit slow grind positive momentum obviously significant uncertainty outlook structural headwinds given lower levels announced regulatory headwinds side q steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc thanks color follow regulatory commentary provided certainly lot helpful color slides thank proposal go written proportion inflation believe mitigated time also hoping could provide context quantum think cecl inclusion could potentially impact scb ccar jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good questions steve think probably early try provide level quantification either front start first basel iii endgame proposal perspective currently focused advocating aggressively possible necessary changes might call philosophical nature things highlighted prepared remarks sort technical nature including things think might actually mistakes proposal talking lot optimizing away stuff might change feels like bit premature point would point given significant operational risk rwa part proposal think sort generic tax across entire spectrum therefore sense nonoptimizable feel important manage expectations level optimization thats possible rule finalized hopefully technical items addressed also depends definition optimization sometimes use term costless optimization whereas technical fixes dont affect revenue dont require exit businesses think type optimization harder find past pointed may simply need exit things better alternative would activity thats shareholder value destructive wont costless good example renewable energy tax credit investment business result quadrupling risk weight may longer make sense thats one hope changed tricky long duration assets rule finalized raises questions whether want put stuff balance sheet sorry bit long answer yeah quantifying cecl ccar think better wait one cause given relative lack transparency feds exact modeling terms quarter peak forth little bit hard predict exact impact putting cecl ccar going know probabilistically like everything else days tend push capital higher q steven chubak analyst wolfe research llc helpful color jeremy thanks taking question jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator thank next question comes ebrahim poonawala bank america may proceed q ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch hey good morning first question jeremy credit think mentioned reserves release tied change central scenario talk us remind us central scenario today changed terms fundamentally credit like seeing softness either consumer commercial side jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah central scenario read research gets put competitors excellent research team seriousness think us economists central case outlook include mild recession think two quarters negative half percent gdp growth fourth quarter first quarter year got revised early quarter sort modest growth think around quarters flowing process acknowledging still skewed downside still reserved significantly higher unemployment rate weightedaverage basis central case outlook number weve sometimes given quarter really much complicated kind following process think question seeing softness credit think answer actually nowhere roughly certainly nowhere thats expected meaning continue see normalization story play consumer less exactly expected course seeing trickle chargeoffs coming office space see chargeoff number commercial bank numbers small less realization allowance weve already built q ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch thats helpful going back details laid basel endgame maybe philosophical side think jamie speaking last month said dont expect changes time make everything makes sense terms pushback falling deaf ears shareholder perspective resigned fact going see towards worstcase outcome play level sort meeting middle road thing gets finalized jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ill let jamie speak point job advocate going guess sentiment washington thousandpage rule proposal know weve got big team smart people studying closely interestingly noted recently analysis impact lending sort forgot like fed preamble forgot billion sic trillion operational risk rwa highlights possibility seemed forgotten simply omitted impact operational risk rwa fees anyway point long complicated technical think probably technical mistakes going forcefully advocate disagree lot stuff technical issues sense resolved technically hopefully theyll listen q ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch got thank jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sorry im getting correction room meant say trillion q ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch yeah got got trillion dollars yup thanks jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co talking actually jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co bpi put something q ebrahim h poonawala analyst bank america merrill lynch bpi yeah thank operator thank next question comes ryan kenny morgan stanley may proceed q ryan kenny analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hey jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi q ryan kenny analyst morgan stanley co llc want dig nii side raised nii ex markets guidance billion year know comments press release suggest jpmorgans earning want triangulate normalized nii look like get normalized next year later jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah couple things let timing question first clear predicting going function marketplace rate environment competitive dynamics forth really trying remind everyone bank current run rates dont fundamentally think sustainable youll aware investor day earlier year tried quantify thought kind normalized range might look like put sort mids type number investor day talked acquisition first republic going push number little bit although overlap forth anyway benefit time everything settled little bit sort push us kind number look like think probably closer billion obvious caveats guess dont know trying point quite bit lower current run rate q ryan kenny analyst morgan stanley co llc got jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co inside company people think itll happen sooner ie people think itll happen later ie jenn marianne jeremy jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co wasnt aware camp actually jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co oh ok jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co dont know im trying opinion operator thank q ryan kenny analyst morgan stanley co llc loan growth side industry loan growth slowed significantly year demand seeing loan growth across different categories know might early talk next year directionally think loan growth given cycle higher capital requirements coming jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure loan growth story pretty consistent weve saying year weve course seen robust loan growth card thats coming spending growth normalization revolving balances look forward still optimistic itll probably little bit muted normalization period jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co auto weve also seen pretty robust loan growth recently function sort slightly competitive pricing side industry little bit slow raise rates lost share previously thats come back generally supply chain situation better thats supported look forward little bit muted think generally wholesale loan growth story going driven economic environment depending believe soft landing mild recession landing slightly lower slightly higher loan growth case would expect relatively muted course home lending remains fairly constrained rates market conditions also think true across board managing things actively mentioned light basel iii may change originations change retain q ryan kenny analyst morgan stanley co llc thank operator thank next question comes gerard cassidy rbc may proceed q gerard cassidy analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jeremy jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey gerard q gerard cassidy analyst rbc capital markets llc jeremy guys put really strong rotce number quarter dive different segments really jumps us exfirst republic roe consumer community banking know jamie talked overearning credit get view fintechs nonbank competitors supposed pick away everybodys market share guys put great numbers whats drivers behind roe even take credit overearning whats driving business profitability high levels jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah gerard id say couple things first credit also deposit margin right talk overearning nii disproportionate amount coming consumer franchise reasons weve talked would also point sometimes dont like word overearning right customers happy theyre cds broader answer question able effectively really comes back decade two decade long history investing future recognizing theres holistic value proposition includes branches app online services entire suite products services around enterprise drives engagement customer loyalty seeing benefits although complacent competition still fintechs still know need continue investing preserve value also true particular circumstances current rate credit environment mean earnings little bit normal core franchise extremely robust q gerard cassidy analyst rbc capital markets llc good follow ties answer deposit margin consumer earlier comments jamie internal debate inside jpmorgan migration rates going higher funding side noninterestbearing deposits think around total deposits slightly guys back prepandemic expectation youre going see noninterestbearing deposits go interestbearing repricing interestbearing deposits folks inside jpmorgan little cautious net interest income number jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question gerard think little bit bigger picture im sure get questions good question im sure reported interestbearing noninterestbearing split best lens look couple reasons first like wholesale retail weve got amount noninterestbearing wholesale thats part ecr product see dynamics play consumer world savings paying relatively lowrate paid crosschecking savings migration dynamics probably different right course even within consumer across consumers small businesses youve got slightly different dynamics terms people manage operating balances would tend zoom little bit see holistic answer thats driven internal migration checking savings cds ecr interestbearing wholesale potential response rate environment competitive environment overall level systemwide deposits terms product level reprice may may happen moments future q gerard cassidy analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank operator thank next question comes erika najarian ubs may proceed q erika najarian analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning jeremy first question sort maybe reasking question different way new guide net interest income year would imply exit run rate billion fourth quarter think dynamics higherforlonger one hand fixed rate assets continue reprice even asked lot deposit dynamics could continue creep higher think puts takes think relative exit rate billion fourth quarter jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah erika think simple answer question believe fourth quarter exit number equates billion run rate ex markets kind saying jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co billion jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah isnt meant say jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co said billion jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co oh didnt hear okay anyway jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co didnt model way jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co call billion run rate exit rate basis saying think something bit normal closer billion thats one building block underneath think one thing thats interesting actually percentage deposits cds increases sort balance internal migration betas rate volume little bit less binary little bit smoother look type stuff model migration balances product level reprice get lower zero bound cd mix world things get little bit smoother would say overall itll interesting watch obviously one important things us company right everything manage also worth remembering big picture point client franchise weve often said focused primary bank relationships didnt lose last cycle planning lose cycle thats sort longterm focus means us jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co would add quantitative tightening large number dont exactly know effect wholesale consumer remember also fed rrp program also sucking money fed directly reducing deposits thats still trillion q erika najarian analyst ubs securities llc thank second question maybe zooming basel iii endgame impacts clearly complex overly complex completely agree unnecessary point backward looking guess complex fact generated basis points cet quarter rwas guess question understand public advocacy process hear loud clear terms could harm terms pricing main street dislocating pipes american capital markets jpmorgan change natural return profile jamie know lingered little bit barclays september end day feels like portfolio managers jpmorgan cycle basel iii endgame really harm natural earnings power returns jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah okay thats good question erika think theres couple pieces let take important piece first cycle target keeping light basel iii endgame proposal short answer going change number today look weve disclosed increase capital start acknowledging major headwind returns jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co simple terms talk earnings power returns theyre two different things right little bit pedantic numerator denominator okay say numerator doesnt change dilute numerator increased capital thats significantly lower return number would say thats probably lower bound terms impact basel iii endgame couple reasons one hoping changes two rule final seek reprice places thatll different consumer wholesale product level relationship level hopefully mitigate course flip side thats cost getting passed real economy thats part point weve made lowering availability products services lending may opportunities costless optimization im personally little bit pessimistic weve surprised points past well see finally yeah may stop certain things may exit things wouldnt necessarily assume thats going lot preserve returns thats going exiting things shareholderdestructive necessarily producing much higher returns know mean thats part question implicitly talking organic capital generation think important separate impacts economy impacts longterm returns ability meet requirements course jamie always says jpmorgan going fine building lot capital managing capital conservatively well able build necessary capital order achieve ontime early compliance always strive doesnt really particular bearing question longterm return target impacts real economy q erika najarian analyst ubs securities llc got thank operator thank next question comes glenn schorr evercore isi may proceed q

llc right thank jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thank operator thank next question comes jim mitchell seaport global may proceed q jim mitchell analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning jeremy think theres receptivity among regulators regarding double counting operational risk think alluded earlier markets business theres clearly double counting market risk trading book receptivity jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co answer real quickly dont really know onesided conversation generally say put comments everyone going put extensive comments kind like heard jeremy dont really know dont really know whats going inside fed many people get involved view become politicized process opposed technical analysis think required exactly right well see q jim mitchell analyst seaport global securities llc okay werent change talked potential negative impact liquidity markets business specifically jpm pulling certain businesses type event comment thered fewer providers liquidity less scaled players exit maybe thats almost equal market share gain opportunity jpmorgan smaller business jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co think look markets alone huge think increase capital look product products worse others generally bad across products really important thing market making critical function look world large market makers could make markets governments hospitals cities schools states imf world bank blackrock blackstone various things buy sell clients size market makers different function hedge funds dont know real intent another one think needs really thought trying accomplish market making quite safe weve never lost kind money people talk market making global market shock something like thing market making agree could actually force people force lower positions think little risky may also force consolidation clients since need much may consolidation unintended way market making obviously volatile markets constraints lcr slr capital et cetera constantly limitations jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah think last point jamies particularly important sure want construct would consider optimistic argument higher cost business lead smaller scale players exit thats share gain opportunity us refer back comments disincentives beneficial diversification scale getting bigger especially markets quite expensive example gsib perspective wind kind hemmed sides one reasons sort highlighting seem like way sometimes look cumulative effect everything thats happened markets last years fundamentally different system obviously jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co great opportunity european market makers mean great opportunity like repo fx swaps credit stuff less capital big difference kind business q jim mitchell analyst seaport global securities llc right thats helpful thanks operator thank last question comes matt oconnor deutsche bank line open q matt oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning talked increased investment spend areas response earlier question think cost control overall looking medium term outlook revenue obviously pressured least net interest income fees might help backdrop potentially declining revenue least flattish revenue couple years know always say want invest cycle really paid time thinking cost control next years jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mean wish sort answer fit better framework fundamental sense kind dont agree framework sense weve last couple years right world rates drop suddenly recover like quite dramatically credit becomes abnormally good rebounds youve seen significant fluctuations capital markets saw going revenue environment change lot short term reasons largely control course parts expense base short term directly sensitive revenue environment adjust naturally adjust forcefully function volumes things much structural goal make sure things sized appropriately believe sustainable cycle returns always focused cost rest assured discipline internally aggressive ever go budget cycle longterm plays really shouldnt expect us see trying generate cosmetically lower costs response lower revenue environment didnt balloon costs revenue became weve argued unsustainably high q matt oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah fair enough could squeeze first republic obviously contribution coming multiples higherthanexpected think puts takes terms think theres probably runoff loans still come also opportunities deepen relationships jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah youre right contribution runoff loans notable first republic related net income weve printed quarter first thing say dont think first republic related net income number quarter sustainable indicator future run rate dynamics weve talked particular overearning deposits sort normal deposit margins also apply first republic franchise degree would expect normalize probably significantly things alluded accelerated pull par commitments took fair value discount part acquisition thats shortterm tailwind revenue come next quarters yeah terms going overall deepening relationships remains focus think happen continue integration continue stabilizing yeah think said press call things going well arguably little bit better wed sort modeled part acquisition happy see q matt oconnor analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank much operator thank questions jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer
