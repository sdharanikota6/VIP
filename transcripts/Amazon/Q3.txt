“We had a strong third quarter as our cost to serve and speed of delivery in our Stores business took another step forward, our
AWS growth continued to stabilize, our Advertising revenue grew robustly, and overall operating income and free cash flow
rose significantly,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “The benefits of moving from a single national fulfillment network in the
U.S. to eight distinct regions are exceeding our optimistic expectations, and perhaps most importantly, putting us on pace to
deliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29-year history. The AWS team continues to innovate and deliver
at a rapid clip, particularly in generative AI, where the combination of our custom AI chips, Amazon Bedrock being the easiest
and most flexible way to build and deploy generative AI applications, and our coding companion (CodeWhisperer) allowing
enterprises to have the equivalent of an experienced engineer who understands all of their proprietary code is driving
momentum with customers, including adidas, Booking.com, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips, and United Airlines,
all of whom are starting to run generative AI workloads on AWS. Between AWS re:Invent and our 29th holiday shopping
season, this is a particularly action-packed time of year at Amazon and we’re excited for what’s to come.”
Highlights
Obsessing over the customer experience
Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day with new and improved products and services.
This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:
•

Sold hundreds of millions of items worldwide during Prime Big Deal Days, Amazon’s largest two-day October
holiday kick-off event ever. Prime members across 19 countries saved more than $1 billion on millions of deals. On
the first day of the event, U.S. Prime members purchased more than 25 million items with Same-Day or Next-Day
Delivery, with hundreds of thousands of items delivered within four hours of purchase.

•

Announced new Buy with Prime features to help merchants grow their businesses on their own websites, such as the
ability to integrate Buy with Prime with Shopify. The Buy with Prime app for Shopify will make it easier for Shopify
merchants to manage their businesses, with inventory, pricing, and promotions automatically synced in one place. In
addition, Buy with Prime Assist enables merchants to offer 24/7 post-order customer service support at no additional
cost, and the Buy with Prime cart feature allows customers to purchase multiple Buy with Prime products in one
transaction from a single merchant.

Inventing on behalf of customers
Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that
customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better
in some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:
•

Launched product review highlights, a new generative AI–powered feature that lets shoppers in Amazon’s U.S. store
quickly determine what other customers are saying about a product before reading through reviews. Review highlights
provide a short paragraph on the product detail page with features and customer sentiment frequently mentioned across
reviews.

•

Introduced generative AI capabilities to help sellers create product listings as part of numerous innovations at

the last five years, Amazon has invested $10 billion in hourly employee wages.

•

Added 14 benefits to Amazon’s FamilyFlex program, which provides operations employees and their family members
with tools to help them achieve personal and professional growth. New benefits include financial wellness resources,

more than 2,000 academic programs and up to $5,250 in annual tuition coverage.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and communities.
Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that
Amazon:
•

Supporting humanitarian aid efforts amid the Israel-Hamas war. Amazon is focused on ensuring that employees in the
area are safe and have access to resources such as My HR Live Support, where employees can discuss their specific
situations with advisers, and the Employee Assistance Program, which provides resources to support employees and
their families. Amazon’s disaster relief team has been in close contact with international humanitarian relief partners
and is making financial contributions to these organizations. Amazon is making it easy for employees to contribute to
them through Amazon GIVEhub, an internal tool to support volunteerism, donations, and community engagement.

•

Activated Amazon’s disaster relief teams to provide support in response to the Maui wildfires, Hurricane Idalia in
Florida, and the earthquake in Morocco. Amazon mobilized its global logistics infrastructure and inventory, and
quickly donated more than 300,000 relief items. Additionally, AWS helped set up temporary communications
infrastructure to provide internet and phone connectivity in Maui in collaboration with the Information Technology
Disaster Resource Center, and funded mappers to assess the earthquake-affected areas in Morocco.

•

Committed to promoting the safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology in collaboration with the
White House, policymakers, technology organizations, and the AI community. The commitment builds on Amazon’s
approach to responsible AI development and lays the groundwork for enhancing the benefits of AI and minimizing its
risks.

•

Published the company’s latest Economic Impact Study, which estimates that Amazon generated more than $240
billion in investment in the U.S. in 2022 and supported more than 2 million indirect jobs across industries such as
logistics, construction, hospitality, and professional services, among others.

more than 50 countries volunteered with over 400 community organizations around the world.

•

Announced that 90% of electricity consumed by Amazon in 2022 was powered by renewable energy sources—up
from 85% in 2021. From 2014 through 2022, Amazon’s wind and solar farms helped generate $12.6 billion in
investments for communities around the world, and contributed more than $5.4 billion in global gross domestic
product (GDP). Amazon now has more than 400 wind and solar projects globally.

•

Announced that the company will require suppliers to share their carbon emissions data with Amazon and set carbon
goals beginning in 2024, and that Amazon will provide tools and resources to help suppliers reach their goals. Amazon

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of October 26, 2023, and are subject to
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events,
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors
detailed below.
Fourth Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
•
•

Net sales are expected to be between $160.0 billion and $167.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 12% compared
with fourth quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign
exchange rates.
Operating income is expected to be between $7.0 billion and $11.0 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in fourth
quarter 2022.
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in

Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.
