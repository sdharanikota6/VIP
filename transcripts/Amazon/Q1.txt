“There’s a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,” said Andy
Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while
increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery
speeds ever in 2023). Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning
investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong
results for brands. And, while our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we
continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to
more easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI with our uniquely cost-effective machine
learning chips (“Trainium” and “Inferentia”), managed Large Language Models (“Bedrock”), and AI code companion
CodeWhisperer. We like the fundamentals we’re seeing in AWS, and believe there’s much growth ahead.”
Highlights
Obsessing over the customer experience
Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands,
developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon:
•

Continued to delight customers with convenient delivery options and broad selection. Nearly 26 million customers
ordered items with Same-Day Delivery in the quarter, an increase of 50% compared to last year.

•

Increased selection in its U.S. online store with the addition of new marquee beauty, home, and fashion brands,
including Lancôme, Shiseido, World of Martha by Martha Stewart, Rent the Runway, KNOW Beauty by Vanessa
Hudgens, as well as new The Drop collections from Harlem Fashion Row and Coco & Breezy. The Drop offers
customers access to limited-edition, made-on-demand clothing collections by fashion influencers.

•

Launched a new Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) capacity management system to help sellers who use Amazon’s
storage, packing, and shipping fulfillment service to manage their inventory and capacity more efficiently as they scale
their businesses. The management system provides sellers with more insight, predictability, visibility, and control to
better plan and manage their inventory and supply chains, as well as increase capacity limits when needed.

•

Released the third annual Brand Protection Report highlighting the company’s efforts to protect customers, brands, and
selling partners from counterfeit products in 2022. The efforts resulted in more seized products, criminal referrals, and
industry partnerships than ever before. The report demonstrates how Amazon is stopping bad actors and making an
impact beyond Amazon’s store, including by identifying, seizing, and appropriately disposing of more than 6 million
counterfeit products, preventing them from reaching customers and being resold elsewhere in the global supply chain.

•

Launched Reviews from Amazon, a new capability that enables Buy with Prime merchants to display customer ratings
and reviews from Amazon.com within their own online stores at no additional cost. Nearly 20% of Buy with Prime
merchants are already using this feature, and the early feedback is that it’s helping merchants drive higher shopper
conversion.

•

Acquired One Medical, a primary care organization offering both 24/7 virtual care services and in-office visits across
the U.S. for preventive and everyday health, chronic care management, pediatric care, and mental health services. For
a limited time, One Medical is offering annual memberships to new customers at the discounted price of $144 for the
first year (regularly $199/year), the equivalent of $12 per month.

•

Announced that Prime Video will exclusively present the first-ever “Black Friday” National Football League game on
November 24. The game will be available for all fans to stream for free in the U.S. without a Prime membership.

•

Set box-office records with MGM’s premiere of Creed III, directed by and starring Michael B. Jordan. The movie
grossed $100.4 million globally in its opening weekend—the best U.S. debut for any sports film in history. It also had
the biggest global box office gross of any of the Creed titles, at over $250 million to date, and is still opening in
territories around the world. In addition, filmmaker Sarah Polley won the Academy Award for Best Adapted
Screenplay for MGM’s Women Talking.

•

Premiered Amazon Original limited series Daisy Jones & The Six, based on the New York Times best-selling novel,
which debuted at No. 1 on Prime Video globally. Within 24 hours of release, the show’s soundtrack was the No. 1
selling vinyl on Amazon, and the novel the series is based on also reached No. 1 on the Amazon Best Sellers List for
all books. The company debuted additional Amazon Original films and series, including action comedy Shotgun
Wedding, starring Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel; romantic comedy Somebody I Used to Know, directed by Dave
Franco; comedic thriller The Consultant, starring Christoph Waltz; and Swarm, from co-creator and executive
producer Donald Glover.

•

Won four Ambies, the premier podcasting award, for Amazon Music and Wondery podcasts I Hear Fear (Best
Scriptwriting, Fiction), Business Wars (Best Business Podcast), The Lead (Best Sports Podcast), and Scamfluencers
(Best Entertainment Podcast).

continue expanding AWS’s infrastructure footprint, delivering the most secure, extensive, and reliable cloud
technology to millions of customers around the world.

Inventing on behalf of customers
Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that
customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better
in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon:
•

Announced new AWS tools that make building with generative artificial intelligence (AI) easy, practical, and costeffective for organizations of all sizes. The tools include:
•

Amazon Bedrock, a new managed service that offers customers the easiest way to build and scale enterpriseready generative AI applications. Amazon Bedrock provides easy access to leading foundation models (ultra-

large machine learning models that generative AI relies on) from AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, and
Stability AI, as well as exclusive access to the Titan family of foundation models developed by AWS. Broad
access to models gives customers flexibility and choice to customize and scale to their specific needs.
•

Two next-generation compute offerings to deliver the lowest cost for training models and running inference in
the cloud: the general availability of instances powered by AWS-designed Inferentia2 chips, AWS’s secondgeneration accelerator, purpose-built for deep learning inference, as well as the general availability of
network-optimized Trn1n instances for large, network-intensive models. Compared to other EC2 instances,
Inferentia2 provides up to 40% better inference price performance, and Trainium delivers up to 50% savings
on training costs.

•

General availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI coding companion that improves developer
productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. Amazon CodeWhisperer is free for individual
developers. CodeWhisperer is the most accurate, fastest, and most secure way to generate code for AWS
services, including Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3. During a productivity challenge,
participants who used CodeWhisperer completed tasks 57% faster (on average) and were 27% more likely to
complete them successfully than those who didn’t use CodeWhisperer.

•

Received Zoox’s driverless testing permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, marking a key step to
commercializing the self-driving robotaxi for the general public. With this permit, Zoox completed an initial run of its
shuttle service for employees at its headquarters in Foster City, California, making it the first purpose-built robotaxi to
operate on public roads in California.

•

Expanded the Ring lineup with new devices. Ring Battery Doorbell Plus offers improved HD video and energy-saving
features, and Ring Peephole Cam is an apartment and renter-friendly video doorbell that easily installs over an existing
door peephole.

•

Expanded the Amazon-built TV lineup with the Fire TV 2-Series, which makes getting an Alexa-enabled TV more
affordable than ever, and new sizes of the Omni QLED Series. The Omni QLED Series includes features so customers
can see their schedule on the screen, control smart devices, and turn the TV into an in-home art gallery. Amazon has
surpassed 200 million Fire TV devices sold globally. Amazon also launched Amazon-built TVs in Germany, Mexico,
and the UK, and collaborated with Cochlear to help people with hearing loss stream sound from their Amazon smart
TVs directly to their Cochlear hearing implants.

•

Unveiled three customer terminal designs for Project Kuiper, Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite broadband initiative.
Kuiper’s mission is to bridge the digital divide by providing fast, affordable broadband to communities worldwide that
are unserved or underserved by traditional technologies. To use Kuiper’s broadband, residential and commercial
customers will install an outdoor antenna, called a customer terminal, to communicate with satellites overhead.
Amazon is preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network this year
and plans to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024.

•

Opened Amazon Sidewalk to developer testing for the first time as part of the company’s vision to put a billion
Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the network. Amazon Sidewalk is a low-bandwidth, long-range community
network that connects devices across long distances where Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals often cannot reach. With
Sidewalk coverage extending to 90% of the U.S. population, developers can now build and connect a new range of
devices for the network.

•

Launched a loyalty linking capability for Amazon One, Amazon’s palm recognition service that lets customers enter,
identify, and pay. Panera is the first restaurant chain to offer the new loyalty linking capability, allowing customers to
easily enroll in and redeem rewards, and pay for their purchases with just their palm.

Empowering employees and delivery service partners
In addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service partners.
For example, in the first quarter, the company:
•

Announced plans to spend $200 million on safety technologies across Amazon’s U.S. transportation network in 2023.
These innovations include front-collision warning, lane-departure warning, speed limiters, and 360-degree camera
detection systems. They are part of Amazon’s work to ensure that vehicles and delivery partners are safe on the road,
and the innovations are better for the environment.

•

Announced that Amazon improved recordable incident rates worldwide by 11% from 2021 to 2022 and by almost 24%
from 2019 to 2022. The company shared the data in the second edition of its safety report, Delivered With Care, which
details how Amazon is advancing safety across its operations through investments in capital improvements, safety

technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions to reduce risks for employees, partners, and
communities.
•

Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S.,
Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help
employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive
tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.

•

Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual
ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the
quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.

•

Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the
program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and
confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:
•

Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.

•

Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.

•

Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and
now has thousands on the road.

•

Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.

•

Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science,
technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

•

Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia,
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.

•

Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events,
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.

Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
•
•

Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from
foreign exchange rates.
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter
2022.
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.
