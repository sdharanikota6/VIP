“It was another strong quarter of progress for Amazon,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “We continued lowering our cost to
serve in our fulfillment network, while also providing Prime customers with the fastest delivery speeds we’ve ever recorded.
Our AWS growth stabilized as customers started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment, and AWS has
continued to add to its meaningful leadership position in the cloud with a slew of generative AI releases that make it much
easier and more cost-effective for companies to train and run models (Trainium and Inferentia chips), customize Large
Language Models to build generative AI applications and agents (Bedrock), and write code much more efficiently with
CodeWhisperer. We’re also continuing to see strong demand for our advertising services as the team keeps innovating for
brands, including the ramp up for Thursday Night Football with the ability for advertisers to tailor their spots by audience and
create interactive experiences for consumers. We remain excited about what lies ahead for customers and the company.”
Highlights
Obsessing over the customer experience
Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands,
developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:
•

Delivered its largest selection of products to U.S. Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in the quarter. The
company now offers U.S. Prime members free Same-Day or One-Day Delivery on tens of millions of the most popular
items. Across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day
in the quarter. So far this year, Amazon has delivered more than 1.8 billion units to U.S. Prime members the same or
next day—nearly four times the number of units delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019.

•

Held the biggest Prime Day event ever on July 11-12, in the third quarter, as Prime members worldwide purchased
more than 375 million items and saved more than $2.5 billion. This year, Amazon offered more deals than any past
Prime Day, with Home, Fashion, and Beauty among the top-selling deal categories. This was the largest Prime Day
ever for Amazon’s independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, and the first where
U.S.-based Prime members could shop deals directly from merchant sites using Buy with Prime.

•

Increased selection in the U.S. Amazon store. Amazon added new beauty and fashion brands, including D’Amelio
Footwear, Dyson hair care, IT Cosmetics, Ralph Lauren Fragrances, and Urban Decay, and extended its collaboration
with Victoria’s Secret. This marks the first time Victoria’s Secret lingerie and apparel are available through a retail
partner in North America. Amazon also expanded its selection of grocery items from brands such as General Mills and
Coca-Cola.

•

Announced Amazon Business is one of our fastest growing offerings, with a $35 billion annualized gross sales run rate
and serving more than 6 million customers. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities, and organizations to
procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at discounted prices.

•

Enabled customers worldwide to save more than $1 billion in the last 12 months through Subscribe & Save, a program
that helps customers save time and money on regularly scheduled deliveries. Customers select their preferred delivery
frequency for eligible products and can cancel or change their subscription at any time. The program has tens of
millions of global subscribers with hundreds of millions of subscriptions.

•

Announced that Amazon Day deliveries, which give Prime members the ability to choose a designated day of the week
that makes sense for them to receive their orders, saved 136 million boxes in 2022. On top of making deliveries work
for customers’ personal schedules, this free Prime benefit uses 30% fewer boxes on average.

•

Released Amazon’s annual U.S. Small Business Empowerment Report for 2022, which detailed that more than 60% of
sales in Amazon’s store came from independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses. U.S.based independent sellers sold more than 4.1 billion products and averaged more than $230,000 in sales. Amazon also
announced a Small Business Search filter, which helps customers easily discover and shop for products from small
businesses and artisans while shopping in Amazon’s store.

•

Marked the 10th anniversary of Amazon.in and announced that Amazon India has enabled cumulative ecommerce
exports of over $7 billion. By 2025, Amazon India has a goal to enable cumulative ecommerce exports of $20 billion,
digitize 10 million small businesses, and create 2 million jobs in India.

•

Premiered AIR, which launched in more theaters worldwide than any previous Amazon Original film. The film
subsequently debuted on Prime Video and ranked No. 3 on Nielsen’s Streaming Top 10 list during the first three days
of its release. The company also premiered additional Amazon Original films and series including the final seasons of
Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan and Emmy-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel; the global spy thriller Citadel, which was
the No. 1 title on Prime Video in nearly 200 countries and territories during its premiere weekend; and Emmy-

nominated Jury Duty, which was the No. 1 title on Freevee during the month it premiered and delivered the highest
number of viewers in the U.S. on Freevee in a single month.
•

Earned 68 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including three nominations in the Outstanding Comedy Series
category for Prime Video’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Freevee’s Jury Duty, and MGM’s Wednesday. Jury Duty
became the first advertising-based video-on-demand series nominated in a major Emmy category, while The
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel became the most nominated streaming comedy in Emmy history with 80 nominations over its
five seasons. Daisy Jones & The Six also earned nine nominations and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
earned six nominations.

•

Grew Prime Video’s international slate of content with more than 40 new local Amazon Originals and live sporting
events. Medellín (France) and My Fault (Spain) became the most watched non-English-language local Original titles in
Prime Video history outside of their home territories. New global programming also included Deadloch (Australia),
Caravana das Drags (Brazil), The Gryphon (Germany), Dahaad (India), Takeshi’s Castle (Japan), De Viaje con los
Derbez Season Three (Mexico), and Gangs of Lagos (Nigeria).

•

Launched Amazon MGM Studios Distribution to license Amazon Original and MGM library content to third parties
after debuting on Prime Video. This will include movies and TV series, such as Coming 2 America and The Marvelous
Mrs. Maisel, among others. Titles available cover a variety of highly marketable formats and genres with distribution
rights available.

•

Partnered with Pinterest to display ads on its website for products sold in Amazon’s store, where over 463 million
people go each month to find recipes, home, and style inspiration. As Pinterest’s first partner for third-party ads,
Amazon will make it easier for customers to discover and buy relevant products on Amazon and provide value for
brands and advertisers.

AWS continued to expand its infrastructure footprint to meet customer demand, launching AWS Local Zones in
Auckland, New Zealand, and Manila, Philippines, and an Amazon CloudFront location in Nigeria.

Inventing on behalf of customers
Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that
customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better
in some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:
•

Announced new AWS technologies and capabilities that help customers of all sizes take advantage of generative AI,
improve productivity, and enhance their security posture. These include:
•

More choice for Amazon Bedrock customers with the addition of Cohere as a foundation model provider and
the latest foundation models from Anthropic and Stability AI.

•

Agents for Amazon Bedrock, a capability that makes it easier for developers to create generative-AI based
applications that can complete complex tasks and deliver customized, up-to-date answers based on

communities in which the company has a significant presence. For example, the company:

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of August 3, 2023, and are subject to
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events,
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.
Third Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
•
•

Net sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.0 billion, or to grow between 9% and 13% compared
with third quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 120 basis points from foreign
exchange rates.
Operating income is expected to be between $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in third quarter
2022.
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.
