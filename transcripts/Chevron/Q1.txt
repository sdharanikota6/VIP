advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics (including
coronavirus (COVID-19)) and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; disruptions in the company’s global supply chain,
including supply chain constraints and escalation of the cost of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in
the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the
military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the global response to such conflict; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins;
actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources
or product substitutes; development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s
suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; the inability or failure of the company’s jointventure partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from
existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned
projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather,
cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company’s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or
assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken
or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation
and regulatory measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the
company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing
conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations,
taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements
compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the
receipt of required Board authorizations to implement capital allocation strategies, including future stock repurchase programs and dividend
payments; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the
company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under
the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 26 of the company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this presentation could also have material adverse
effects on forward-looking statements.

This transcript has been edited by Chevron Corporation. It is generally consistent with the original conference
call transcript. For a replay of the Investor Conference Call, please listen to the webcast presentation posted on
chevron.com under the headings “Investors,” “Events & Presentations.”
Operator:

Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today.
Welcome to Chevron’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a
question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. If anyone should
require assistance during the conference call, please press star and then zero on your
touchtone telephone. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now
turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.

Jake Spiering:

Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call
and Webcast. I’m Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman
and CEO, Mike Wirth, and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to
the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron’s website. Before we
begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on slide two. Now, I
will turn it over to Mike.

Mike Wirth:

Thanks, Jake. Chevron delivered strong financial results again last quarter – the seventh
consecutive quarter with return on capital employed greater than 12%.
This enabled another record for cash returned to shareholders while maintaining a strong
balance sheet.
Since our Investor Day two months ago, we’ve remained focused on executing our plans:
• Achieving important milestones in our project in Kazakhstan,
• Continuing to build activity levels in the Permian,
• Positioning Bayou Bend to be one of the largest carbon storage projects in the
United States, and
• Safely and reliably delivering oil, products and natural gas that help power the
global economy.
Next week, we’ll publish our Corporate Sustainability Report. I encourage you to review
it on our website as we provide updates on the ESG topics that matter to our business and
our stakeholders.
In closing, while commodity markets remain uncertain, our approach is unchanged:
capital and cost discipline applied to advantaged assets in both traditional and new energy
businesses and steady returns of cash to shareholders.
You can see that consistency in our actions and our results.
Now over to Pierre to discuss the quarter.

3

Pierre Breber:

Thanks, Mike.
We reported first-quarter earnings of $6.6 billion or $3.46 per share. Adjusted earnings
were $6.7 billion or $3.55 per share.
We had one special item this quarter related to changes in the energy profits tax in the
United Kingdom. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of nonGAAP measures.
Strong operating cash flow enabled Chevron to deliver on its financial priorities during
the quarter:
• 6% per share dividend increase,
• Higher Capex within budget,
• Net debt ratio under 5%, and
• Share repurchases at the top of our prior guidance range.
Adjusted first quarter earnings were up over $200 million versus last year despite 20%
lower oil prices.
Adjusted Upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations and adjusted
Downstream earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins.
Both segments benefited from a change in timing effects.
Higher interest income and lower accruals for stock-based compensation decreased All
Other charges.
Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down $1.1 billion.
Adjusted Upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower realizations. Other items
include the absence of last quarter’s dividend withholding tax at TCO and lower
exploration and transportation expenses.
Adjusted Downstream earnings were essentially flat, lower margins and volumes were
offset with higher chemical earnings and other favorable items including trading results.
Lower accruals for incentive-based compensation decreased All Other net charges and
also benefitted the operating segments.
First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80 thousand barrels per day from
last year due to the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford
asset. This was partially offset by growth in the Permian.
We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells put on
production (POPs) increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our
royalty production to be roughly flat.
As discussed during our investor day, we’re increasing activity in New Mexico. All four
company-operated rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico; leading
to more POPs expected in the second half of the year and into 2024.
We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our company operated
production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas; with the remainder split, about evenly,
between the Midland Basin and New Mexico.

4

More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large,
contiguous positions in core areas with multi-year development programs, where we have
visibility to capex and execution schedules, and a royalty benefit compared to the
operator.
The balance is with dozens of other operators where we have a little less visibility but
similar predictability from greater diversification.
More than half of our royalty production comes from the Pecos River area, in the heart of
the Delaware Basin. The balance of our royalty position is in the remainder of the
Delaware and Midland Basins, also with well-known operators.
In summary, Chevron has a large, diverse position in the Permian, with a unique royalty
advantage, where we learn from our own operations and from others.
Now, looking ahead.
In the second quarter, we expect planned turnarounds at Gorgon and in the Gulf of
Mexico, along with downtime at an FSO in Thailand, and a number of planned refinery
turnarounds.
Also, we expect share buybacks to increase to a $17.5 billion annual rate.
In summary, first quarter was another quarter with strong financial results, continued
capital discipline, and a steady return of cash to shareholders. We’re confident that
consistent and straightforward management, through commodity cycles, will create value
for stakeholders.
Back to you, Jake.
Jake Spiering:

That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.
Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will do our best to get all
your questions answered.
Katie, please open the lines.

Operator:

Thank you. If you have a question at this time, please press star one on your touchtone
telephone. You may ask one question and a follow-up question. If your question has been
answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press star two. If you are
listening on a speakerphone, we ask you please lift your handset before asking your
question to provide optimum sound quality. Again, if you have a question, please press
star one on your touchtone telephone.
Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.

Devin McDermott:
(Morgan Stanley)

Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.

Mike Wirth:

Good morning, Devin.

Devin McDermott:

Good morning. There were some helpful detail in the slides and the remarks on the
breakdown of Permian operations.
If I look at the quarter, your volumes did fall a bit sequentially in 1Q versus 4Q, I was
wondering if you could just talk in a bit more detail about some of the drivers there? How
5

things are going as you ramp New Mexico activity, and then specifically, the confidence
that you have in that back-half weighted production ramp?
Mike Wirth:

Thanks, Devin. Pierre tried to show a little more detail, including breaking out COOP
[company-operated], NOJV [non-operated joint venture] and royalty, talking about
drilling activity and feet drilled, etcetera. Glad that that was helpful.
First quarter’s performance was a function of the fact that NOJV and royalty production,
which as you can see from that chart [on Slide 9] is a meaningful portion of our overall
production, was down a little bit from fourth quarter of last year.
This gets a little lumpy due to how it gets reported by partners. Over time, it has trended
up, particularly the NOJV piece, but it was a little lumpy. It was down first quarter versus
fourth quarter last year. COOP production was mostly flat from fourth quarter of last year
to first quarter of this year.
In terms of the full-year outlook, on Slide 9, we show the full-year outlook. It’s about 770
thousand barrels a day. 2022 was a little bit over 700 thousand [barrels a day], 707
thousand [barrels a day]. Our COOP production will grow in the mid-single digits.
NOJV, we expect to grow in the mid-teens and royalty is roughly flat year on year is our
expectation. That lays out first quarter.
We still think that the guide we’ve given is appropriate, as Pierre said, back-end loaded.
So, we’ll be updating each quarter on that [guidance].

Devin McDermott:

Got it. Makes sense. Thanks. My follow-up is on TCO, it’s exciting that we’re now less
than a year away from start-up there.
Back at the investor day, you noted that you had shifted to commissioning and the startup work for WPMP. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how things
are going, the latest expectations on timing, and then also the key milestones that we
should be keeping an eye out for the balance of this year ahead of start-up?

Mike Wirth:

Yeah, absolutely. I actually was in Kazakhstan earlier this month. I had a chance to meet
with the president of the Republic and some other senior officials.
I also spent time down at Tengiz and visited the job site. I talked to people from our
construction team, people from the commissioning team, and people from operations as
we’re preparing for start-up.
It looks a little less like a construction site, a little bit more like a plant than it did the last
time I was down there. The progress is very obvious. The headline I’ll give you is there’s
no change to our cost or schedule guidance.
We expect WPMP start-up to begin by the end of this year. That’s a conversion of the
field from high pressure to low pressure. That will take some time as we take all the
metering stations and field infrastructure down to low pressure. But that will still begin
by the end of this year.
The start-up of the Future Growth Project (FGP), the portion that adds 260 thousand
barrels of oil production, will begin by mid-next year.
Both of these [start-ups] require a series of turnarounds and tie-ins. It’s quite a complex
set of activities to get us to the point where we’ve got everything online.

6

There’s a lot of work behind us. While I was there, we achieved mechanical completion
on the third-generation sour gas injection facility, which was ahead of schedule.
There are a number of milestones that we talked about at the investor day that we’ve
achieved.
We completed tie-in of the fuel gas system to the first gas turbine generator. We fired up
that generator, so, we know that it’s working.
In the second quarter, in terms of milestones to watch for: we’re working to commission
boilers, steam system, and other utilities that are required for the start-up of the pressure
boost facility, which is the key driver of that conversion from high-pressure to lowpressure field operations to enable sustained well deliverability.
In the third quarter, we expect mechanical completion of the Future Growth Project.
As I said, we’ll begin start-up activities on the field conversion to low pressure by the end
of this year.
Those are some of the key milestones. A lot behind us, but there’s still a lot of complex
work ahead. We’ll be updating you on it every quarter.
Devin McDermott:

All good to hear. Thanks, Mike.

Mike Wirth:

All right, Devin. Thank you.

Operator:

We’ll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Neil Mehta:
(Goldman Sachs)

Thank you so much, Mike and Pierre. The first question is just around the LNG portfolio.

Mike Wirth:

A lot of volatility in the global gas markets over the course of the last year. Just curious
on how you guys are seeing the outlook and any updates on your portfolio, particularly
down in Australia where we recognize you’re going to be taking some maintenance? But
it seems like it’s operating pretty well.
Overall, it’s been a bit of a wild ride in gas markets over the last year. We’ve seen prices
extraordinarily strong.
If you go back two years ago, they were extraordinarily weak. [Prices] have certainly
moderated now as we’ve had warmer weather in the northern hemisphere through the
wintertime and as the situation in Europe has become a little more stable.
Certainly, inventories both in Europe and in the U.S. are much healthier than people were
concerned about at one point in time. We’re into a market that still is perhaps strong by
historic standards, but certainly not nearly as strong as what we saw.
Operations at Gorgon and Wheatstone are running very well. We had a record number of
LNG cargoes out of Australia last year. It was 10% better than the best year we’ve ever
had.
Reliability was first quartile for the two facilities, so we feel good about that. This year
we’ll start the second turnaround cycle, which is a four-year cycle to turn trains around at
Gorgon. Train one will have a major planned turnaround in the second quarter of this
year.

7

We’re working on the next stage of field development to continue to keep the field full.
Wells drilled and start-up [and] tie-in activity, etcetera, is underway on the next phase of
the gas development to bring that into the facility.
Things in Australia are good from an operational and a reliability standpoint.
More broadly speaking, we continue to look at opportunities in our LNG portfolio
beyond Australia. We’ve talked at some length about the Eastern Med, so I won’t belabor
that, but I would expect to select a concept on the Leviathan expansion by the end of this
year.
In Equatorial Guinea, we’re looking at opportunities to bring additional gas resources in
through existing infrastructure.
We are continuing to be very focused on what we can do to add value in our LNG
business, but to do it in a way that is returns accretive.
Neil Mehta:

That’s great. And then the follow-up is just on return of capital. I think you have been
pretty clear about the range that we should be thinking about from a buyback perspective.
On dividend growth, just talk about how you expect that to track relative to your free
cash flow per share expectations?

Mike Wirth:

I think we have been clear on buybacks, so I won’t spend time on that.
On dividends, I would say our track record should speak for itself. Of course, these are
decisions that are made by the Board [of Directors] each year, but we’ve got 36
consecutive years now of higher payouts [per share].
Over the last five years, our dividend growth per share has been double that of our closest
peers. We’ve sustained this not just over the long haul, but also in the short term through
the volatile period of time that we’ve seen.
Our dividend track record, I think, stands very well.
Reiterating our four financial priorities. The first of which is to sustain and grow the
dividend, as I just mentioned. [Our dividend saw a] 6% increase earlier this year, and a
compound annual growth rate of 6% over the last 15 years. I’ll say our track record on
the dividend speaks for itself.
Pierre mentioned that the quarter we just closed included highest ever cash distributions
to shareholders for the fourth consecutive quarter. We can say that.
We’re very mindful of continuing to deliver cash in a predictable and consistent manner
back to shareholders through both of those vehicles.

Neil Mehta:

Thanks, Mike.

Mike Wirth:

Okay, Neil. Thank you.

Operator:

We’ll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.

Roger Read:
(Wells Fargo)

Thank you. Good morning. Coming back to the Permian a little bit.
I know you’ve been providing us a lot more detail on things and I appreciate that and the
detail for the overall production breakdown in the U.S.
8

But looking at the Permian, the Chevron-operated portion versus your JV Non-op, as we
think about some of the snags that have been hit over the last couple of quarters, where
have been the biggest problems? Has it been in the operated or the non-operated? And
then as you think about correcting those over the next couple of quarters, how much of
that is Chevron control versus partner?
Mike Wirth:

I will speak to our operated operations because I really can’t speak on behalf of the other
[operators]. They should speak on behalf of their operations, but we certainly learn from
those.
We spent a good amount of time at the investor day talking about the learnings on the
drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) wells that had sat for a long time. We [also] talked about
the prior basis of design for the wells, including spacing and proppant loading. I’m
talking about multi-bench development.
We’ve learned a lot from our own operations and those learnings are augmented by the
things that we learn from others. We also talked about [the shift to] more single-bench
development and more activity in New Mexico. We continue to be very focused on
driving strong returns and not optimizing production or some other metric.
Just to give you a little bit more guidance, Roger, for this year in terms of how to think
about it. We expect royalty production to be roughly flat in the neighborhood of a little
bit over 100 thousand [barrels a day], maybe 110 thousand barrels a day. Most of that
comes from the Pecos River area where we’ve got big operators. OXY is the largest
operator in that area but other well-known operators are in that area [as well]. And then
we have some [production] that comes in from the Midland [Basin] as well, from big
operators where there’s a lot of visibility into what their plans are.
Our COOP production growth, we expect to be mid-single digits for the full year, maybe
a touch higher than the midpoint of single digits. We expect roughly 190 wells to be put
on production (POPs) this year, down a little bit from last year, maybe 10%, when our
COOP production increased 35 thousand barrels a day.
We have growth on the Texas side of the Delaware [Basin] earlier in the year, and the
New Mexico side later in the year, which follows the chart Pierre showed you with
drilled lateral feet [on Slide 9].
In NOJV, the growth is higher. It’s in the mid-teens for the full year. The gross number of
POPs in our NOJVs are expected to be up about 15% year-on-year. Our net POPs
actually increase more than the gross because we have relatively high working interest
and a significant royalty advantage in the NOOPs. So, a 15% increase in gross POPs
actually translates into more production than you might presume.
We have really good visibility into the execution schedule. We’ve received more than
three-quarters of the AFEs for this year’s activity, and operations have actually begun on
more than three-quarters of the NOJV wells that we expect to be POPed this year. It’s a
mix.
We’ve got a really strong but complex portfolio because of these three different
contributors.
We’re continuing to hold the guidance, at about 770 [MBOED] for full year.

Roger Read:

No, that’s great. I appreciate that. And follow-up question, I suspect is for you, Pierre.
Working capital, obviously, tends to be a draw in Q1. You’ve got what sounds like a
9

decent level of planned maintenance in Q2. So just any thoughts on how we should look
at overall cash flow generation in Q2 and maybe rest of the year in terms of the cadence?
Pierre Breber:

In terms of working capital, Roger, the first quarter, as you said, was a build on working
capital, draw on cash, and that was primarily inventory related.
Last year, we had draws on working capital that were primarily through taxes payable.
You’ll see in the second quarter some of those payments happening. We try to give
everything excluding working capital because over the course of time that tends to zero
out. There is a pattern, but there’s some variability around it. That’s the guidance I would
give to you.
In terms of free cash flow and cash from operations, it depends on commodity prices and
margins. We gave a lot of that [detail] during our investor day and some upside and
downside cases.
In terms of working capital, you’ll see timing effects. We try to look through them and
exclude them. Next quarter, you should expect some large tax payments, which will be a
draw on cash.

Roger Read:

Okay, great. Thank you.

Operator:

We’ll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.

Paul Cheng:
(Scotiabank)

Hey, good morning, guys.

Mike Wirth:

Morning, Paul.

Paul Cheng:

[First statement inaudible]. For your low carbon investment, not those that are for only
emission mitigation activity, but in terms of CCUS as a new business. For that kind of
business, what is the minimum internal rate of return and payback period that you will
assign in order for you to sanction the projects?

Mike Wirth:

Paul, the reality is these are brand-new businesses. We have a lot of confidence in the
returns and payback periods that we expect out of businesses we’ve been in for many
decades, understand very well, and that have well-established markets.
These are businesses that don’t exist today. They are in part enabled by government
policy, the rules of which are not yet fully written and the durability of which we need to
ask ourselves questions about as we commit capital to it.
They’re different. They are very different. Our goal over the long term is to get similar
returns out of these businesses as we get out of our core business. That would be doubledigit returns.
In the midterm to the near term, we’re going to have to go into some of these things that
offer high growth and opportunity with our eyes wide open. But also understand that as
we establish them, in the early days, we may not see the returns that we expect in the
fullness of time.
We make big investments. Our expectation is over the lifecycle of these investments
we’re going to deliver those kinds of returns.
We’re also mindful of the fact we have to develop technology. We have to scale these
[businesses]. We have to help markets mature. We have to build operational experience.
10

We have to build risk management experience, supply chain, and customer capabilities in
these businesses. In the near term, we will be understanding of the fact that the returns in
the short term will probably look different than our long-term expectations.
We won’t go into things that we don’t believe offer the long-term prospect for returns.
Which is why we have steadily avoided more well-established sectors like wind and
solar. We could go into those today because the risks are better defined but we also
understand the returns. They don’t offer the kinds of returns we expect out of the things
that we’re working on.
Paul Cheng:

A second question is that your largest U.S. competitor just announced that they’re going
to push more aggressively into trading and establish a single trading organization. They
think that there’s quite a fair amount of opportunities out there in the market that they can
capture. I am essentially thinking maybe that is somewhat of a playbook from Europe.
I think Chevron has always been a little bit more conservative on [trading]. So, do you
think that there is an opportunity for a company similar to Chevron that has a lot of
global reach and a lot of physical assets and has an edge over others? Is that an
opportunity that we may be missing for Chevron?

Mike Wirth:

Paul, what I would say is I think maybe your perception is a little bit miscalibrated from
what I would describe. We have always had a global trading organization for many, many
years. I used to run it. Pierre used to run it.
We’re an active trader. We trade in a certain way. I’ll give you the three-word
overarching description: We flow, optimize and trade.
The first role of our commercial organization is to ensure our barrels and molecules flow
to the market.
The second is to optimize assets, ships, market positions, market knowledge and be sure
we get the most value out of our system that we possibly can.
The third responsibility is to trade. We do third-party trading. We do what we call Quad
Four trading, on a regular basis, we make money at it. We have very talented people in
our organization that do it.
We also have good risk management systems to ensure that we understand what we’re
doing. I wouldn’t describe us as not being a trader. I don’t know if there’s a definition. I
think you used the word conservative.
We’re a trader, but we do it in the order that I just described and have done it for a long
time on a global basis. It’s a contributor to our earnings and we continue to look to grow
that part of our business.

Pierre Breber:

The only thing I would add, Paul, to Mike’s answer is shareholders and investors don’t
own Chevron or like companies for trading earnings. They tend to be volatile.
I think the multiples on trading earnings historically have been very low. In fact, most of
the large trading houses are private companies.
Mike described exactly what our strategy is. It works within the framework of a resource,
refining and petrochemicals company where investors are owning us for safely and
reliably delivering energy [while also] having commodity price exposure. If we can
enhance that with trading results, that’s great, but we’re not going to lead with trading.

Mike Wirth:

Thanks, Paul.

Paul Cheng:

Okay. Thank you.

Operator:

We’ll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.

Sam Margolin:
(Wolfe Research)

Good morning. Thank you.

Mike Wirth:

This one is just a clarification question on something you said about the Permian because
I think it’s important in the NOJV section. Because you stack royalties with the NOJV
acreage, your growth rate in the NOJV portion actually exceeds the growth rate of your
partners as they report it. That’s the correct interpretation, right? That’s what we’re trying
to communicate?
Yes, we not only get working interest production out of it. We have relatively high
working interest in most of these ventures. It’s not dissimilar to the working interest of
the operator in most cases. But then we also have a royalty advantage. And we account
for that, or we report that to you, through NOJV.
What we describe as royalty barrels are pure royalty, where we have no capital and no
working interest. We’re just collecting royalties as the landowner.
But you’re correct in your interpretation, Sam. That is why our NOJV is growing a little
faster than our COOP production for the same levels of activity.

Sam Margolin:

Okay, thanks. Then just as a follow-up, this is on capital allocation.
I understood that you have the range out there on the buyback, but the range is pretty
substantial. There is a decision to make right now about where to be within the range,
about whether to preserve cash for an opportunity that might come in a downturn, if
that’s what looks like is on the horizon. Or whether to stay at the top end because we’re
in a market equilibrium in the commodity environment, and you feel good about the pace.
I’m not asking you to predict the future, but it would be great to hear your thoughts
directionally about the value of preserving cash on the balance sheet for a rainy day or
maintaining a faster pace? Thanks.

Mike Wirth:

I’m going to invite Pierre to say a couple of words. But Sam, we tried to lay out a couple
of cases at investor day that showed you in two different price environments what our
capacity was to operate and be within the range, and with a low breakeven to cover our
capex and dividend with a lot of surplus cash already on the balance sheet.
With the very low debt levels that we have, we’ve got plenty of capacity. Pierre, maybe
you just give a thumbnail recap on the scenarios to bookend them for Sam.

Pierre Breber:

In our investor day, we looked at the high-case and low-case scenarios. Our guidance
right now is towards the high end.
Let me just first be clear that we don’t intend to hold $15+ billion of cash on our balance
sheet. We can run the company with $5 billion, and this is surplus cash. This is cash that
is temporarily on the balance sheet.
It will be redistributed and redeployed to shareholders over time, depending on the
scenario and the price. Both scenarios had us working down that surplus cash because it’s
economically inefficient for us to hold it. And it’s not our cash, it’s our shareholders’
cash.

12

We want to return it through the cycle in a steady way, not pro-cyclically. That’s why it’s
accumulating. We’ve paid off all our debt economically, but it’s a timing effect.
We’ve showed in the low-side case, which averaged about a $60 Brent [from 20232027], that we could continue buybacks near the low-end of the range, and we can do that
by taking surplus cash down and then also using some of our excess debt capacity
because we’re well below our 20% to 25% net debt ratio. We would want to work
towards that low end of that guidance range of 20% again, to get to a more efficient
capital structure.
In terms of keeping cash for a rainy day, we’re always going to maintain a strong balance
sheet. We’ve been in this business for decades and decades. We know the good times
don’t last. We know that prices are cyclical. We want to manage that volatility for our
shareholders. Our shareholders don’t have to worry about the commodity price because
they’re going to get the dividend that Mike talked about, that has been growing for 36
consecutive years. That’s grown 6% [at a compound annual growth rate] for 15 years.
They’re going to get that.
And then as we approach a cycle, and we’re looking at the cycle coming up here,
[returning] additional cash in a steady way. Right now, [we’re purchasing] about 5% of
our shares outstanding through the form of a buyback.
That’s how we’re planning to manage the volatility for our shareholders.
If M&A is implied in your question, we have shown that we tend to use equity for M&A
because commodity prices are volatile, and it creates a more stable deal structure.
Our balance sheet will always be strong enough to enable us to not only manage
commodity prices but also make sure we’re positioned to do what we need to do.
We were the first to do a transaction coming out of COVID-19 when we announced the
acquisition of Noble Energy, and then we followed a year or so later and acquired
Renewable Energy Group.
Thanks, Sam.
Sam Margolin:

Thank you.

Operator:

We’ll take our next question from John Royall with J.P. Morgan.

John Royall:
(J.P. Morgan)

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.

Mike Wirth:

John, a couple of thoughts. I’ll just go by the product commodities.

Can you talk about the general demand trends you’re seeing within your system? Are you
starting to see any signs of weakness on the demand side? If the answer is no, just curious
on your views on what’s happened to spot refining margins globally and what seems like
still a relatively tight market.

Gasoline demand is essentially back to pre-pandemic levels globally. Obviously, there
are regional variations in this.
We’re sitting in California here on this end of the call. We’ve had a very wet winter. The
first quarter reflects an unusually wet season on the West Coast. In Asia, we see demand
coming back, as economies continue to open and mobility has increased, etcetera. But
broadly speaking, gasoline is flat.
13

Diesel carried the complex through COVID-19 and global demand has been at prepandemic levels for a while now. First quarter demand in 2023 is a touch lower than it
was in first quarter of 2022. This could be an indicator of the beginning of some
economic slowdown. But it’s premature to conclude that. Diesel is not leading the parade
quite as strongly as it had been for the last couple of years.
Jet demand continues to grow and it’s still below pre-pandemic levels. China’s the place,
that everybody has been paying attention to. Domestic travel up to nearly 90% of preCOVID-19 [levels]. Flights in and out of the country still well below that but we see
flights being scheduled. You see indicators that suggest travel will grow. If you listen to
the airlines that certainly seems to be what they anticipate. But that’s what’s in progress.
That’s a quick look across the product slate.
I think margins reflect a couple of things. One year ago, we were in a period of
recovering economies. We’re coming out of a period of rationalizing refining capacity
around the world. If you go to any part of the world, you will find refineries that have
shut down – that perhaps people expected would close one day, but it happened relatively
quickly.
At the same time, big growth projects were deferred because of the uncertainty relative to
COVID-19. A year later, you don’t see refineries closing at the same rate. We’ve seen
refinery start-ups in the Middle East. We’ve seen projects here in the U.S. and in Asia as
well. Refining capacity is coming into the system.
Demand has moderated a little bit. Margins have come down. They’re still stronger than
historic margins if you look out over a longer period of time. They’re trending back down
towards mid-cycle, but still pretty strong in the U.S.
They are under a little more pressure in Asia. You have to think about the feedstocks in
Asia, where they’re coming from, how they’re priced, and how those markets are
working.
I don’t see any big warning signs flashing, but certainly, we’re paying close attention to
it.
John Royall:

Very helpful, Mike. Thank you.
Sticking with the downstream, you mentioned California. Can you just talk about the new
regulations in California around the potential for excess profit penalties?
Not sure if that’s exactly how to refer to it, but how much does that impact how you think
about refining in California and your position in California and maybe the expected
impacts on the broader market there?

Mike Wirth:

The bottom line is this is now into a rule-making process. There’s no impact right now,
it’s into a bureaucratic phase. I think implementation is likely to take quite a while. It’s
hard to say exactly how it plays out. What started as an effort to create a windfall profits
tax, which was unsuccessful because you need two-thirds of a vote in the legislature for a
new tax in California, was then modified into some other form. It ended up moving into
the energy commission, where there will be a group established that will gather a lot of
data and try to assess the profitability of the industry against some standard, which has
yet to be fully articulated.

14

This is going to take some time. It could potentially result in some sort of a fine or a
penalty for margins or profits above a level. I can’t tell you how it’s going to play out
because there’s a lot of work to be done there.
Things that I would say are pretty predictable are: One, there are substantial new
reporting requirements and there’s a lot of data we’re going to have to produce. We’re
happy to do that. We’ll work closely with the Energy Commission to make sure we get
them the information that they’re requesting.
The second is, I don’t think this does anything to encourage investment or new supply,
which is really what’s needed in a commodity marketplace to bring prices down on
average over time. In fact, I think it runs the risk of doing the opposite, of discouraging
investment and decreasing supply over time. If demand does not moderate, it will tend to
exacerbate volatility and over time probably result in, on average, higher levels of price.
That’s about all I know about it at this point, and we’ll watch it as it unfolds.
John Royall:

Thank you.

Mike Wirth:

Thank you, John.

Operator:

We’ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.

Kalei Akamine:
(Bank of America)

Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Kalei on for Doug.

Pierre Breber:

Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the new Permian disclosure. You guys
are forecasting flat royalty volumes. I’m wondering, as that becomes a smaller part of the
production mix, how is the cash margin from that asset affected going forward?
The royalty barrels have essentially an infinite margin. You and Doug can do the math,
it’s a slightly lower percentage than that. That’ll be a partial offset.
But there are lots of other drivers that we’re doing to enhance margins and we’ve shown
return on capital employed near 30% at $60 Brent equivalent for our Permian [asset]. It’s
a high return, low carbon asset, and the royalty barrels come with virtually no costs.
That’s part of the advantage that we have.

Kalei Akamine:

Understood. I appreciate that, Pierre.
My second question goes to TCO. Just wondering if we can get an update on timing of
first oil from the new expansion project and the dividend magnitude for 2023?

Mike Wirth:

The expansion project [has] a lot of turnarounds and activity both this year and next year.
At our investor day, we laid out a bar chart that gave you an idea on production. As I said
earlier, production growth will manifest itself in 2024 because the next two years have a
lot of turnarounds, tie-ins, etcetera in place.
Pierre, you can guide on dividend.

Pierre Breber:

No change in our affiliate dividend guidance that we shared on the last call of $5 to $6
billion for the full year. That includes Tengiz and our other affiliates.
We expect, like last year, a dividend in the second quarter that will be modest and then a
larger dividend in the fourth quarter. TCO continues to hold more cash on its balance
sheet to manage through both completion uncertainty around the project and around
[additional] transport [options].
15

That cash will come back over time. It’s been performing very well, but we don’t give
specifics on [TCO] by year. It’s embedded in our overall affiliate dividend guidance.
Kalei Akamine:

I appreciate that there’s still some turnaround to work through. But as the production hits
a steady state, what do you expect the dividend cadence to look like?

Pierre Breber:

As I said, last year, it was in two quarters. This year again will be second quarter and
fourth quarter. It’s up to the TCO Board of Directors to make dividend decisions going
forward. Thanks for your questions.

Operator:

Our next question comes from Josh Silverstein with UBS.

Josh Silverstein:
(UBS)

Good morning, guys.
Just curious about the pace of rig activity in the Permian. You guys are adding one [rig]
per quarter this year. A lot of that seems to be to support growth next year.
I’m just curious, as you continue looking forward into next year, do you need to add four
more rigs next year to keep that 10% growth pace? Is it less because you’re getting more
efficient in the Delaware production? I’m just curious how you’re thinking about the
step-up in activity going forward.

Mike Wirth:

We pulled rigs down dramatically in 2020 and we didn’t want to surge back with
everything all at once. We entered this year with ten [rigs]. We expect to exit this year
with 14 COOP rigs running.
Consistent with the longer-term production profile that we’ve outlined, we’ve got a big
base business that does have decline underneath it. You can expect us to add some
additional rigs as we move into 2024.

Josh Silverstein:

I know there’s a lot of activity stepping up across the rest of the lower 48, Haynesville,
DJ [Basin]. They’re a little bit more on the gassier side. I’m curious if you guys are
pulling back any activity because they’re a little bit more gas prone in this price
environment? Thanks.

Pierre Breber:

We [added] a rig in the Haynesville. We talked about that for a number of years, building
up to that activity. Gas prices are going to be volatile and frankly, we need to get
developing that resource. We have some offset operators and so it’s the time for us to do
that.
The DJ [Basin] still has a heavy liquids component. No change in our plans. In fact, the
DJ [Basin] and Argentina are a couple of other areas where we expect production in the
second half of the year to be higher. We’re increasing a little bit of activity but all of that
is within our existing capex budget.

Mike Wirth:

Thanks, Josh.

Operator:

We’ll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.

Ryan Todd:
(Piper Sandler)

Thanks.
First off, just a quick follow-up on the comments earlier on with a question on trading in
the international Downstream. Your earnings were particularly strong this quarter. I think
in the slides there, there’s a positive $270 million other bar [on Slide 21]. Is that primarily

16

trading and is there anything to read on that going forward? Is that something that likely
reverses or maybe some clarity there?
Pierre Breber:

You’re right. We refer to it. I would not say it’s primarily [trading], it’s a lot of factors
and we pointed to that. It’s consistent with how Mike described our trading business.
As all trading businesses are, it can be variable in future quarters. It’s just one of many
factors. It’s not primarily [trading], but we wanted to cite it as one of the elements in that
Other variance.

Ryan Todd:

Thanks, Pierre. On the Permian, if we look back at the Permian, at the analyst day you
talked about a variety of the shifts in the 2023 development plan versus 2022. You
highlighted some more here today. I think we appreciate some of the near-term impacts.
Can you talk at all to what some of the longer-term implications are of the shift to more
single-bench development adjustments, to spacing, and more shifts towards New Mexico,
etcetera? Does the move to increase single-bench development have any impact on the
productivity or recovery of other zones in the area? Does it change at all how you think
about service infrastructure and logistics, or how you think about resource depth in
different parts of the portfolio over the long term?

Mike Wirth:

Ryan, I would say not really. We’ve always been returns seeking. This is all about
optimizing the return we can get out of this asset over the long haul.
We’ve tried to be thoughtful about surface infrastructure. We’ve tried to be thoughtful
about drilling to keep surface infrastructure fully utilized, not overbuilding it for peaks
and then leaving it underutilized for long periods of time.
We’re continuing to learn the fundamental principles about optimizing return on
investment, which continues to drive all of this activity. As we learn more about benches,
about communication, about productivity, as technology changes recovery factors, we
will continue to apply all of those learnings.
But the real objective remains the same. It’s not volume, it’s value and returns.

Pierre Breber:

And just as a reminder, the move to more single bench is in the Delaware Basin. In
Midland Basin three quarters is multi-bench developments.

Ryan Todd:

All right. Thanks, guys.

Operator:

We’ll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.

Jason Gabelman:
(TD Cowen)

Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my questions.

Mike Wirth:

Sorry to go back to the Permian, but I’m going to ask another. I appreciate all the
disclosures, they’re really helpful. In terms of the COOP component of production, does
the proportion stay relatively stable through your forecast period? I think you gave a
forecast out to 2027 at the analyst day. Does the COOP proportion stay the same or do
you have more operational barrels between now and [20]27?
It stays relatively similar, Jason. We can provide further insights on that as we go on into
the future, but there is not a big shift. We’re growing activity.
As I mentioned earlier, we’re adding rigs and have a pretty big base we are adding in on
top of. So those percentages don’t move a lot.

17

Jason Gabelman:

All right, That’s helpful. And then just one accounting question. Depreciation fell
decently quarter-over-quarter in Upstream. What was that related to?

Pierre Breber:

Are you looking at it excluding special items?

Jason Gabelman:

Yeah. If I look at the quarter-over-quarter Slide 7, Upstream DD&A was +345.

Pierre Breber:

Why don’t you follow up with Jake? That could be tied to some exploration activity.

Jason Gabelman:

Okay. Thanks.

Operator:

We’ll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.

Biraj Borkhataria:
(RBC)

Hi there. Thanks for taking my question.
I wanted to ask about Namibia. You recently farmed in a few months ago. Could you just
walk me through your plans for the next 12 months or so on what have you have penciled
in? And then I’ve got a follow-up on something else. Thank you.

Mike Wirth:

We’ve completed seismic acquisition in Namibia at the end of February and that’s being
processed right now. I can’t really comment any further on that. We are certainly mindful
of others who have had exploration success in the region, which is encouraging. We need
to do the work on that and then determine what the next steps are, which could include
drilling exploration wells. Stay tuned on that. If we got more information, we’ll share it
with you, Biraj.

Biraj Borkhataria:

And then on a different topic, cost inflation. Because more and more you hear some of
the service providers talking about improving pricing and so on. Could you just comment
on your latest thoughts and what you’re seeing on the cost inflation side outside of the
lower 48? Thank you.

Mike Wirth:

No change to our mid-single digit inflation guidance in our current year. Capital
spending, as you note in the lower 48, there are some areas where we planned for higher
inflation and are seeing that.
I’ll remind you that a lot of what we do in our procurement activities are longer-term
contracts that are either fixed-price or index-based. We’ve got detailed cost models to
challenge price increases.
We commit volumes to certain things over longer periods of time to try to create a winwin between us and our suppliers. We’ve not seen some of the costs push through that
you would see if you were buying services or commodity inputs on a spot basis or a
current basis, because we manage that activity differently.
For instance, on offshore rigs, we’re fully contracted for this year. We came into the year
with three rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico. They’re generally below current market
rates. I think we’re managing this well. The one thing I would say is given these indexbased contracts, there are periodic reviews where we will reset based on market
indicators. In the second quarter, in certain parts of our business, we’ll be going through
this with some of our partners and we’ll see some resets that will probably reflect a little
bit of the inflation that I referred to earlier that’s already built into our plans. I think we’re
managing all that within the range that is embedded in the guidance we’ve given you.

Biraj Borkhataria:

Great. Thank you very much.

Mike Wirth:

Thank you, Biraj.

Operator:

Thank you. We’ll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.

Patrick Henry:
(Truist Securities)

Hi, this is Patrick Henry on behalf of Neal Dingmann.

Mike Wirth:

For my question, it’s with respect to Venezuelan exports. I know previously you made
mention of no further capital investment in Venezuela. We’re curious to know if there is
a maximum threshold of exports and sales that you’re anticipating out of Venezuela?
Is there a maximum? It’s limited by our position there and the entities that we’re involved
in and our portion of that production that we’re entitled to market. We’re currently seeing
about 100 thousand barrels a day of production, up from about 50 thousand [barrels a
day] when the license terms changed.
That could go up further this year, maybe another 50% if everything goes well. The crude
comes to the U.S. and we’re finding a market for the crude. It’s a six-month license from
OFAC so we have to bear that in mind. We’ve got some past receivables that are being
paid from some of these proceeds and there’s a lot of relatively straightforward
workovers and other activity that can help bring production up without major capital
commitments. That’s the current model.
We’ll see how things unfold, and hopefully, pointed in a good direction. But it’s been a
bit of an up-and-down situation. We just have to take this one step at a time.

Patrick Henry:

Good stuff there. I guess, just as a follow-up. Are you exploring that six-month term? Are
you looking to extend that at all or is it too early to be negotiating on that?

Mike Wirth:

That’s a decision made by the U.S. government. It’s not really a negotiation. It’s their
decision and it’s a policy matter. We’re asked for input and so we provide input on these
things. But for the last several years, these things have had relatively short timelines
associated with them. We’re in full compliance with all the conditions of the sanctions
and intend to stay that way. We’ll just see how the policymaking turns out.

Patrick Henry:

Thanks very much.

Pierre Breber:

Hey, this is Pierre. I’m going to go back to Jason’s question. The lower depreciation [for
Upstream] is really caused by three drivers. Some of it was the absence of some
abandonment accruals that were in the fourth quarter. You can view those as nonrecurring. And then some of it is due to new rates. Each year we revised our depreciation
rates based on additions to proved reserves and those rates are a little bit lower. And then,
first quarter production was a little bit lower than fourth quarter production. Lower
volumes also contributed to that lower depreciation.

Jake Spiering:

I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in
Chevron and your participation on today’s call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back
