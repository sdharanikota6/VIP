begin midnext year startups require series turnarounds tieins quite complex set activities get us point weve got everything online theres lot work behind us achieved mechanical completion thirdgeneration sour gas injection facility ahead schedule number milestones talked investor day weve achieved completed tiein fuel gas system first gas turbine generator fired generator know working second quarter terms milestones watch working commission boilers steam system utilities required startup pressure boost facility key driver conversion highpressure lowpressure field operations enable sustained well deliverability third quarter expect mechanical completion future growth project said well begin startup activities field conversion low pressure end year key milestones lot behind us

standpoint broadly speaking continue look opportunities lng portfolio beyond australia weve talked length eastern med wont belabor would expect select concept leviathan expansion end year equatorial guinea looking opportunities bring additional gas resources existing infrastructure continuing focused add value lng business way returns accretive neil mehta thats great followup return capital think pretty clear range thinking buyback perspective dividend growth talk expect track relative free cash flow per share expectations mike wirth think clear buybacks wont spend time dividends would say track record speak course decisions made board directors year weve got consecutive years higher payouts per share last five years dividend growth per share double closest peers weve sustained long

downside cases terms working capital youll see timing effects try look exclude next quarter expect large tax payments draw cash roger read okay great thank operator well take next question paul cheng scotiabank paul cheng scotiabank hey good morning guys mike wirth morning paul paul cheng first statement inaudible low carbon investment emission mitigation activity terms ccus new business kind business minimum internal rate return payback period assign order sanction projects mike wirth paul reality brandnew businesses lot confidence returns payback periods expect businesses weve many decades understand well wellestablished markets businesses dont exist today part enabled government policy rules yet fully written durability need ask questions commit capital theyre different different goal long term get similar returns businesses get core business would doubledigit returns midterm near term going go things offer high growth opportunity eyes wide open also understand establish early days may see returns expect fullness time make big investments expectation lifecycle investments going deliver kinds returns also mindful fact develop technology scale businesses help markets mature build operational experience build risk management experience supply chain customer capabilities businesses near term understanding fact returns short term probably look different longterm expectations wont go things dont believe offer longterm prospect returns steadily avoided wellestablished sectors like wind solar could go today risks better defined also understand returns dont offer kinds returns expect things working paul cheng second question largest us competitor announced theyre going push aggressively trading establish single trading organization think theres quite fair amount opportunities market capture essentially thinking maybe somewhat playbook europe think chevron always little bit conservative trading think opportunity company similar chevron lot global reach lot physical assets edge others opportunity may missing chevron mike wirth paul would say think maybe perception little bit miscalibrated would describe always global trading organization many many years used run pierre used run active trader trade certain way ill give threeword overarching description flow optimize trade first role commercial organization ensure barrels molecules flow market second optimize assets ships market positions market knowledge sure get value system possibly third responsibility trade thirdparty trading call quad four trading regular basis make money talented people organization also good risk management systems ensure understand wouldnt describe us trader dont know theres definition think used word conservative trader order described done long time global basis contributor earnings continue look grow part business pierre breber thing would add paul mikes answer shareholders investors dont chevron like companies trading earnings tend volatile think multiples trading earnings historically low fact large trading houses private companies mike described exactly strategy works within framework resource refining petrochemicals company

landowner youre correct interpretation sam nojv growing little faster coop production levels activity sam margolin okay thanks followup capital allocation understood range buyback range pretty substantial decision make right within range whether preserve cash opportunity might come downturn thats looks like horizon whether stay top end market equilibrium commodity environment feel good pace im asking predict future would great hear thoughts directionally value preserving cash balance sheet rainy day maintaining faster pace thanks mike wirth im going invite pierre say couple words sam tried lay couple cases investor day showed two different price environments capacity operate within range low breakeven cover capex dividend lot surplus cash already balance sheet low debt levels weve got plenty capacity pierre maybe give thumbnail recap scenarios bookend sam pierre breber investor day looked highcase lowcase scenarios guidance right towards high end let first clear dont intend hold billion cash balance sheet run company billion surplus cash cash temporarily balance sheet redistributed redeployed shareholders time depending scenario price scenarios us working surplus cash economically inefficient us hold cash shareholders cash want return cycle steady way procyclically thats accumulating weve paid debt economically timing effect weve showed lowside case averaged brent could continue buybacks near lowend range taking surplus cash also using excess debt capacity well net debt ratio would want work towards low end guidance range get efficient capital structure terms keeping cash rainy day always going maintain strong balance sheet weve business decades decades know good times dont last know prices cyclical want manage volatility shareholders shareholders dont worry commodity price theyre going get dividend mike talked growing consecutive years thats grown compound annual growth rate years theyre going get approach cycle looking cycle coming returning additional cash steady way right purchasing shares outstanding form buyback thats planning manage volatility shareholders implied question shown tend use equity commodity prices volatile creates stable deal structure balance sheet always strong enough enable us manage commodity prices also make sure positioned need first transaction coming covid announced acquisition noble energy followed year later acquired renewable energy group thanks sam sam margolin thank operator well take next question john royall jp morgan john royall jp morgan hi good morning thanks taking question mike wirth john couple thoughts ill go product commodities talk general demand trends youre seeing within system starting see signs weakness demand side answer curious views whats happened spot refining margins globally seems like still relatively tight market gasoline demand essentially back prepandemic levels globally obviously regional variations sitting california end call weve wet winter first quarter reflects unusually wet season west coast asia see demand coming back economies continue open mobility increased etcetera broadly speaking gasoline flat diesel carried complex covid global demand prepandemic levels first quarter demand touch lower first quarter could indicator beginning economic slowdown premature conclude diesel leading parade quite strongly last couple years jet demand continues grow still prepandemic levels chinas place everybody paying attention domestic travel nearly precovid levels flights country still well see flights scheduled see indicators suggest travel grow listen airlines certainly seems anticipate thats whats progress thats quick look across product slate think margins reflect couple things one year ago period recovering economies coming period rationalizing refining capacity around world go part world find refineries shut perhaps people expected would close one day happened relatively quickly time big growth projects deferred uncertainty relative covid year later dont see refineries closing rate weve seen refinery startups middle east weve seen projects us asia well refining capacity coming system demand moderated little bit margins come theyre still stronger historic margins look longer period time theyre trending back towards midcycle still pretty strong us little pressure asia think feedstocks asia theyre coming theyre priced markets working dont see big warning signs flashing certainly paying close attention john royall helpful mike thank sticking downstream mentioned california talk new regulations california around potential excess profit penalties sure thats exactly refer much impact think refining california position california maybe expected impacts broader market mike wirth bottom line rulemaking process theres impact right bureaucratic phase think implementation likely take quite hard say exactly plays started effort create windfall profits tax unsuccessful need twothirds vote legislature new tax california modified form ended moving energy commission group established gather lot data try assess profitability industry standard yet fully articulated going take time could potentially result sort fine penalty margins profits level cant tell going play theres lot work done things would say pretty predictable one substantial new reporting requirements theres lot data going produce happy well work closely energy commission make sure get information theyre requesting second dont think anything encourage investment new supply really whats needed commodity marketplace bring prices average time fact think runs risk opposite discouraging investment decreasing supply time demand moderate tend exacerbate volatility time probably result average higher levels price thats know point well
