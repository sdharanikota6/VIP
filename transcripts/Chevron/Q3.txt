asking question provide optimum sound quality question please press star one touchtone telephone well take first question roger read wells fargo roger read wells fargo yes thank good morning hoping could dig international upstream little short expecting quarter factors ones called fx issue tax benefit nigeria mike wirth yes roger ill let pierre cover little detail recognize quarter tough one model theres pretty material significant noncash charges timing effects primarily inventory costs see rising prices tax reserves charges legal abandonment things lower realizations mixed lag effect lng pricing timing inventory costs particular periodtoperiod comparisons prior period whether last quarter quarter last year prices coming current period see prices strengthening significantly really get pretty significant deltas way cost inventory go back first quarter similar dynamics anyway thats kind high level pierre maybe talk little bit upstream international upstream particular pierre breber yes subset talked mike roger largest timing effects quarter cargoes water youll see primarily international upstream international downstream timing effects three buckets paper marktomarket onthewater inventory onland inventory really cargoes water drive effect cargoes transit cross quarterly periods thats trajectory prices mike indicated really drives mike talked abandonment estimates show depreciation saw international upstream lng see lag pricing also saw mix contract cargoes spot cargoes lng liquid side saw mix effects bit liftings relative production terms tax jurisdictions types products trade terms discounts brent number items international upstream could follow roger jake cover details operator well take next question josh silverstein ubs josh silverstein ubs good morning tco mentioned expect cash flow billion lower around billion versus billion previously due project delays higher cost estimates lower affiliate distributions something else thats driving mike wirth yes josh theres going capital said think around billion chevron share probably little weighted cash flow operations lower billion brent total next years really due delay project equivalent barrels day net production years total expect share dividends lower billion across prior guidance combination things previously guided billion seeing billion chevrons share tcos free cash flow brent little coming production cash flow ops opposed capex pierre breber delay wpmp doesnt impact really incremental production effects mike talking production really delay startup fgp obviously adds incremental production operator well go next neil mehta goldman sachs neil mehta goldman sachs yes thank want stay tco question think mike biggest gating factors getting completion around fgp walk us landscape key milestones watching watching give us conviction project coming service mike wirth main message neil completed wpmp mechanical completion fgp weve begun get deep commissioning weve previously mentioned worked technical issues utility systems saw impacts commissioned independent cost schedule review cycle normally annually didnt want wait saw evidence things going slower discovery work sent independent team give us cold eyes assessment cost schedule think main thing would distill recommendations embedded updated guidance today reflect conservative forecast commissioning progress assuming things take longer prior plan assuming going discovery items tend come complex projects like response weve implemented significant changes terms approaching weve moved contract resources gi portion future growth project completed fully commissioned onto commissioning work weve added contract resources weve brought experienced turnaround operations people skilled discovery work managing restart operations facilities help us weve also added technical resources address unplanned discovery items would come weve significant change approach weve got conservative guidance issuing well continue talk every quarter main things look weve got big compressor trains start pressure boost key driver highpressure lowpressure conversion large machines key milestones weve got metering stations converted high pressure low pressure next quarters theres think someodd metering stations go entire field weve got two big turnarounds ive talked key milestones well tracking closely well update go forward operator well go next devin mcdermott morgan stanley devin mcdermott morgan stanley good morning thanks taking questions wanted stick upstream actually ask venezuela youve increase production yearoveryear given initial sanction relief theres obviously additional sanction relief announced since last quarterly call think might interview morning made comments could see sequential increase production yearend wondering could step back talk impact sanction relief production profile also willingness invest region remind us impactful venezuela volumes corporate cash flow mike wirth sure seen action us government previously operating ofac license modified beginning year general license theres specific licenses go define terms operate recent action new general license issued ofac really kind opens operating room others us doesnt materially change circumstances think youll see people lifting crude youll see crude flow us dont think impact operations really particularly significant something around barrels day maybe barrels day earlier year still think get yearend seeing improvements expect theres see balance year cash going pay legitimate operating expenses tax royalties recover past dues owed really working would call pretty straightforward field maintenance things restore production arent particularly longcycle capitalintensive staying within kind cash thats generated sales order fund would expect thats posture well remain see longerterm sanctions environment plays political situation country elections like continue make progress recovery past dues mentioned lot change guess would say point view pierre maybe want comment cash production pierre breber yes consistent mike said continuing cost affiliate accounting means dont record production reserves thats reflected numbers record earnings receive cash recording proportionate share equity earnings actually receive cash thats something well continue look mike said depending potential triggers road elections could go back equity accounting point time made decision yet terms cash flow cash flow modest course mike said operations continuing well getting little bit cash well see goes operator well go next biraj borkhataria rbc biraj borkhataria rbc capital markets hi thanks taking question im sure youll get tco want ask permian last quarter gave helpful data points well productivity year wondering particularly new mexico side incremental comments wells drilled third quarter know pretty small sample size pops first half year comments would helpful mike wirth yes might give kind broader commentary permian performance well overall production little bit quarter entirely driven nonoperated joint ventures primarily couple operators delays putting wells online due frac hits factors also takeaway capacity permian highway constraints resulted unplanned downtime coop production third quarter essentially flat prior quarter guided thats despite wells choked back due surface constraints one development area seeing higherthanexpected co content gas others area well weve got thirdparty handling process facilities constrained cant handle co choking wells back theres new federal regulation wont get details affects meter production prevents comingling weve got wells choked back get new meters place weve got produced water limits come effect areas theres number things indicative well performance surface realities working way impacting coop production little bit new mexico youre right got pops second half year weve popped planned wells new mexico balance almost half come fourth quarter pop performance generally strong wells hit facility constraints ive talked overall well performance aligned type curve expectations think get fourth quarter call biraj well come back detail type curves well enough online well enough months start give kind evidence last quarter show performance operator well go next sam margolin wolfe research sam margolin wolfe research thanks good morning maybe well stick us ask us upstream capex number theres lot moving parts youve got incorporation pdc kind gom projects ballymore coming play inflation timing effects alluded guess think quarters us upstream capital would characterize overall would say sort plan overly influenced one factors may may mitigated time mike wirth sam youre right seeing pressure us think probably going end higher budget end year pdc integrated factory pretty much expected increment wasnt original plan really driver big thing seeing feet drilled per rig completion feet planned permian productivity primary development activity continued improve means spend money tubulars sand water anticipated kind good news brings costs also permian weve got long lead items seeing supply chain realities say need place long lead orders earlier things otherwise would ordered next year weve actually moved ordering initial payments year theres long lead dynamics going mentioned earlier produced water becoming issue permian reinjection way minimizes incidences induced seismicity weve got produced water handling infrastructure spend would say kind primary drivers thats pushing permian little hot gulf mexico pretty well right plan youre seeing really function pdc increment thats added additional costs permian program really hadnt anticipated went year pierre breber ill add take inorganic million yeartodate million third quarter primarily aces million pdc third quarter million ratable budget course fourth quarter tends higher mike says well likely end year little bit budget operator well go next paul cheng scotiabank paul cheng scotiabank thank good morning go back tco little bit late stage cost increase everything guess question mean learned process ensure future project execution become better facing entire problem mean challenging project along think number different reasons quite frankly bit disappointing last stage bit slip schedule also cost increase thank mike wirth yes paul thank share sentiment understand youre coming big complex project youve along whole ride know early engineering issues confronted addressed middle big thing pandemic demobilizing remobilizing building medical facilities whole bunch stuff manage way complex difficult folks great job clearly impacted cost schedule big thing paul remember redoing power infrastructure entire field geographically speaking enormous space infrastructure frankly goes back lot soviet days theres entire new power distribution system taking entire field highpressure production lower pressure wpmp process building really large sour gas injection incremental production facilities almost fieldwide refurbishment lot big increment production commissioning incredibly complex went cost schedule review relatively early commissioning process based seeing became evident need account complexity schedule dont think fully reflected schedule big complex project like find things early found challenges utility system cost us time ripples guidance giving really would say conservative assumes kinds things going encountered balance project need set expectations realities going dealing thats schedule delay commissioning bulk construction completed equipment really final commissioning process well could end front end windows gave weve given experience says plan weve got plan reality things mentioned response earlier question neil weve added incremental resources multiple areas anticipate prepared kinds challenges think lesson projects like future commissioning plans reflect complexity completely commissioning plans one pierre breber ill add comments affiliate dividends weve given guide fourth quarter affiliate dividends falls short fullyear guide start year shortfall tco thats cpchem chevron phillips chemical company lower petchem margins also angola lng lower ttf prices assumed weve also angola lng cash come back us return capital terms tco million dividend chevron share second quarter cant get ahead tco board fourth quarter fourth quarter guide related tco ill remind last year tco dividend billion chevron share numbers withholding tax well see pretty significant increase total year tco dividend getting excess cash balance sheet like talking go back period prior start construction period years dividend similar saw time period inflection happening five years either receiving dividends fact putting cash essentially negative free cash flow know production going next year showed youd expect dividends reflect little bit little bit increase capex well heading billion guidance brent seeing positive news terms cash flow coming clearly disappointing news revised schedule going work hard deliver front end range operator well go next john royall jp morgan john royall jp morgan hi good morning thanks taking question followup permian ex pdc q including nonop piece really helpful color mike birajs question leave pretty big jump hit full year guidance q around calculate right sticking mboed guide legacy piece good way think q production general mike wirth yes john changing guidance overall production excluding pdc expect lower end overall guidance permian production expected ramp fourth quarter full year production expected around mboed include pdc yes guidance still intact permian go ahead pierre pierre yes mike talked shortfall nonop averages quarter talked also surface constraints worked overcome shortfall saw nonop third quarter deliver change guidance clearly little work fourth quarter achieve expect fourth quarter pops production line plan laid earlier year operator well go next doug leggate bank america doug leggate bank america thanks good morning everyone mike know youve traveling around thank making time us morning want try defend little bit morning look remaining life tengiz half value taken stock morning cant imagine youre happy announcing series challenges question philosophical level would characterize management team organization avoid kinds issues major projects going forward youve got lot things queue market comfortable execute timeline portfolio mike wirth well doug youre right think reaction market morning weve spent lot time back jay johnson spending time calls traveling around talking capital project execution unique project wont repeat things went earlier paul large multiyear effort supply chains coming way around world russian inland waterway system pandemic weve challenges projects queue remotely similar one kinds things talking factory development projects across multiple shale basins deepwater developments think track record quite different think lessons really complex capital projects despite employing best engineering construction firms world bringing partners strong capability really complex challenging part way mitigate selective ones walked away kitimat lng project despite lot efforts make project better concerns execution kind environment ultimately said going take project like particularly point time part way choose part continuing learn apply learnings many decade ago implemented tco project tco project implemented integrated projects go forward similar complexity look close finish line thing weve got fullcourt press make sure commissioning safe reliable clean startup lessons applied every project pierre breber ill restate impact mike talked billion share dividends brent thats less share clearly lot talked earnings miss know weighs also shares time noncash items timing effects reverse discrete items nonrecurring feel good companys performance quarter terms operated safely reliably captured margin know mike said earlier quarters messy noisy one underlying company strong healthy doug leggate agreed looks overdone pierre thanks much operator well go next irene himona socit gnrale irene himona socit gnrale thank much good morning refer comments higher opex dda pdc legacy assets impacted q upstream business fully sort look bonnet thinking original synergy estimates pdc opex capex long would expect take start accruing results thank mike wirth yes irene think reference simply additive versus prior periods wouldnt want anybody interpret somehow different expected opex dda different expected synergy capture good right track capture synergies change guidance confident theres upside well realize time transactions think theres additional operational midstream procurement synergies didnt build initial target capex synergy captured well nice thing quarter appreciate dougs view maybe reaction little overdone closed transaction five months ahead guidance pick additional production bigger part year earnings cash flow go along weve already paid highcost debt integrating pdc business sound transaction going deliver everything expected operator well go next jason gabelman td cowen jason gabelman td cowen wanted ask whats going middle east footprint youve obviously take tamar offline believe thats fixed price asset youre receiving probably large cash impact could remind us cash impact ability maybe reroute gas somewhere else offset losses think eastern mediterranean growth profile overall theres change youre thinking light recent events thanks mike wirth ill take second part ask pierre address cash production impact doesnt change view development opportunities jason longterm play large gas resource like followon exploration opportunities region working aphrodite field waters offshore cyprus develop working expansion projects sanctioned tamar leviathan expansion ideas leviathan weve got take longterm view measured years decades things shortterm create circumstances see right prepared mitigate risks keep people safe maintain integrity operations doesnt change longterm view attractiveness asset development opportunities ill let pierre address cash question pierre breber dont talk specific contracts numbers think effect youre right theres escalators tied inflation theres oil price sensitivity within sort floor ceiling regional gas prices well international prices dont know long gave guide production impact cash flow modest tens millions dollars terms calculation well see end quarter long shut operator well go next ryan todd piper sandler ryan todd piper sandler maybe switch gears little bit gulf mexico maybe provide update overall basis anticipate addition hess assets gulf impact approach basin coming years youre scheduled separate projects hitting anchor st malo whale come onstream could maybe update us progress projects maybe timing whether expect first half second half year mike wirth sure combination hess think well come back close transaction integrate partners couple projects operate lease positions think would expect us highgrade exploration program look across larger combined lease position well talk go forward terms specific projects yes youre right mad dog actually saw first oil year expect peak next year mad dog refer operator anchor whale expected first oil next year anchor seven wells total two online two two one fpu safely moored field right manifold pump systems subsea manifolds fabricated weve landed tested psi blowout preventer project moving along nicely production modest theres couple wells online think midyear terms general timing id refer shell whale project first oil probably latter part similar kind profile youve got smaller number wells online initially subsequent couple years youre going see additional wells come online production impact starts show greater way ballymore actually first oil come online simpler development tiebacks blind faith three wells two would online third one would come online production little bit youll see pierre breber ryan broadly hess planning hold investor day usual timing well likely either closed antitrust review process big transaction impacting gulf mexico transforming portfolio overall gave guidance potential asset sales also expect us investor day several months close time really put together combined business plan investors operator well go next bob brackett bernstein research bob brackett bernstein research youve spent part week engaging shareholder base making case acquisition hess talk details obviously perhaps tone conversations enthusiasm anything surprised mike wirth id say overall course pierre separate meetings number meetings john hess sometimes larger hess shareholders sometimes larger chevron shareholders would say general people see longterm value proposition clearly think see combined company stronger one set stronger longer ability really sustain cash distributions shareholders consistent predictable durable fashion long future theres doubt questions one side get high enough price side pay much tension honest negotiation mentioned going time john looking way deal actually one thats good sets shareholders easy great asset market recognizes value think find nuances people either held one stocks certain reasons maybe wasnt exactly expected broadly speaking would say people see longterm value creation see transparency resource depth production growth fact hess much diversified set assets attached portfolio derisks anyone assets brings forward cash distributions shareholders meaningfully would still several years future chevron shareholders wondering comes next currently see next several years portfolio rather us pointing range potential answers say well best weve got plenty organic investment opportunities working think gives confidence certainty underpins future broadly speaking kinds discussions weve operator well go next neal dingmann truist neal dingmann truist securities question mike shareholder return continue great financials shareholder return dividend buyback side continues quite high paying bit free cash flow im wondering continue growth opportunities ahead see change shareholder return particularly share buyback continue try balance kind growth buyback programs mike wirth weve consistent set financial priorities many many years first sustain grow dividend consecutive years per share dividend payouts last five years cagr actually last years cagr announcement early next year subject board approval think theres strong track record expect continue second disciplined organic reinvestment business grow cash flows confident continue disciplined reinvestment drive returns value number three strong balance sheet pierre mentioned singledigit net debt ratio today thats lower guided time time expect balance sheet move back towards gearing range weve identified comfortable cycle fourth share repurchases weve got range billion billion high end range close transaction hess billion annually today thats float every year wont go details weve indicated sustain lower price environment thats lower end range would apply certainly higher price environment find today highend range would expect consistent predictable sustain consistent durable key words think broad framework likely remain unchanged think behavior consistent youve come see us historically operator well go next alastair syme citi alastair syme citigroup mike go back hess several years chevron looked bit different integrated oil companies terms low downstream exposure course youre reweighting even upstream balance bother maybe think integrated oil company mike wirth yes alastair short answer doesnt bother actually becoming downstreamweighted company last several years may obvious people capex upstream depreciation upstream business declining percentage capital employed downstream weve made big investments acquired refinery texas acquired renewable energy company weve invested new petrochemical facilities got two petrochemical expansion projects underway right gone weighting upstream downstream chemicals last years close transaction well back weve historically reflects fundamental view believe cycle returns upstream likely structurally higher downstream primarily refineries hard close get built reasons pure economics governments tend intervene transportation fuels markets particular prices high kind takes full cycle economics kind tend clip peaks whereas upstream youve got declining resource base youve got growing demand fundamentals rebalance quickly remove little bit investment see decline takeover see demand continue grow markets get imbalanced upstream rebalance quickly also oilweighted peers fundamentally reflects view alternatives substitute gas particularly power generation liquids transportation kind highlevel drivers portfolio constructed way want integrated company think real opportunities capture economic value integration build capabilities run entire business bringing capabilities technology skills bear across different segments peers weighted downstream ratios little bit different weve long held views constructed portfolio reflects jake spiering would like thank everyone time today appreciate interest chevron participation todays call please stay safe healthy katie back operator thank concludes chevrons third quarter earnings conference call may disconnect
