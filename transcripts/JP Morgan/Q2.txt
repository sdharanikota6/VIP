Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being
recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go to the live presentation. Please stand by.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy
Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 25%.
These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republic lending portfolio of
$1.2 billion as well as $900 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Touching on a few highlights: CCB client investment
assets were up 18% year-on-year, we had record long-term inflows in AWM, and we ranked number one in IB fee wallet share.

Before giving you more detail on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on page 2. The
settlement process with the FDIC is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed. Systems integration is also
proceeding apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid-2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July
2nd and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get the sales force back in
the market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition.

Now turning back to this quarter's results on page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presentation, we have specifically called out the
impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this
quarter's results at the Firmwide level. Then, for the rest of the presentation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to
improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue, $599 million of
expense, and $2.4 billion of net income. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in NIR
in the Corporate segment, as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1 st, so the First Republic
numbers only represent two months of results.

You'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue and allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And for the
purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration
continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now, turning back to Firmwide results excluding First Republic.
Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex.
Markets was down $293 million, largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less
notable items primarily in the prior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up
$1.5 billion or 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And
credit costs of $1.7 billion included net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, predominantly in Card.

The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in Card, and a $243 million release in
Corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of
13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republic. And as you can
see in the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio. And as
you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirement of 4% and it goes into
effect in 4Q23. The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quarter.

On liquidity, our Bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor Day. About half of the reduction
is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10-K, we will be updating our
Earnings at Risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So when we release this quarter's 10-Q, you will see the up 100-
basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have been about negative
$1.5 billion. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. Both U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we
haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results which I
will speak to excluding the impact of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion,
which was up 31% year-on-year.

In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End-of-period deposits were down
4% quarter-on-quarter, as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher-yielding




                                                                                                                     2
products. Client investment assets were up 18% year-on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and
digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year-on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing
and production revenue. Originations were up quarter-on-quarter, driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year-on-year. Moving to Card
Services & Auto, revenue was up 5%, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto
lease income.

Card outstandings were up 18% year-on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto,
originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year-on-year as competitors pull back and inventories continue to slowly recover. Expenses of $8.3
billion were up 8% year-on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest
in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, our credit costs were $1.5 billion,
reflecting a reserve build of $203 million driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge-offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year-on-
year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day-plus delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations.

Next, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.5 billion was
up 11% year-on-year or down 7% excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year-on-year and we ranked
number one with year-to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In Advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30%
for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs
of activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year-to-date announced M&A is
down significantly, which will be a headwind.

Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-on-year. Fixed Income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise
substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and client flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the
Securitized Products Group and Credit. Equity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior-year quarter, particularly in derivatives.
Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates,
partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially
offset by lower fees. Expenses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year-on-year, driven by higher non-compensation expense as well as wage inflation
and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation.

Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42%
year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year-on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross
Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 million was down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of
$1.3 billion were up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology
investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new
client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non-operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were up
2%, reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth in
areas where we are investing.

CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior-year originations for construction loans in Real Estate Banking as well as increased
affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge-offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real
estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market
as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth
Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher
deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year-on-year,
driven by higher compensation, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation, and the impact
of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management in China, both of which closed within the last year.

For the quarter, record net long-term inflows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by Fixed Income
and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.6
trillion were up 20% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares.
And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turning to
Corporate on page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in
Corporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million. Revenue was $985 million, up $905 million compared to last
year.

NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net
investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year-on-year, largely driven by higher legal
expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First Republic in the first
quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction. Next, the outlook on page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be
approximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both
Consumer and Wholesale. And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we
do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out.




                                                                      3
Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to
be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. As we look forward, we remain
focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capital from the pending
finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahead, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to
continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios.

With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.

Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But
maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing
there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think
about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you
guys had talked about?

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.                                                                                                                                                                                              A
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower
deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time
and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment
from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously,
we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next
year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider
this level of NII generation to be sustainable.

And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that
maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to
happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to
be clear that we do expect it at some point.

Okay. But I guess just one follow-up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some
confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.                                                                                                                                                                                              A
I wouldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid-70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in
particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would
be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through-the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't
think of it as being particularly rate-dependent.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Q
Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of
the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you
earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being
said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that
17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a
rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input
on that would be great.

Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.                                                                                                                                                                                               A
Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about
the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was
always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this
explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the
denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to
produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could
be bad.

Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the
denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital
increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the
right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there,
but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the
mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.                                                                                                                                                                                    A
And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very
capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over-earning on
is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to
pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.

And so my follow-up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the
second quarter?

Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just kind of wanted
to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and potentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate
what you heard recently.

Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of very detailed
rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are actually going to get a
proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind
of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people
are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Barr’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the
way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight-up, across-the-board tax on everything.

It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you
have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are
details, there is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track record
of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability
to sort of optimize in a very technical way.

Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes
down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and
buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?

Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments,
right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we
know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the
answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to
returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as
strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.

I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we talked about
the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still
probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But, yeah.

Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade-off between like the commercial economy and
what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment
Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re-opening of markets and the trade-off between getting some more of those fees in
versus what's happening on the loan demand side. Thanks.

Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last month. What I would
talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some
regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the
broader economy and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a
variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especially if we see a little
bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth
away from Card.

But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand-driven
narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.

That makes sense. And as a follow-up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more
slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elaborate a little bit more
on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed
to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade-off on that side too?

Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve
per account has still not gotten to pre-pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our
portfolio at this point. And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.

Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions and the
asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact
that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?

Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher
rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios. But at the margin, we've
been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of that is just the
consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on
making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of change in our
positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural
interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ensure that net-net we
are still about the same as we were last quarter.

Very good. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned in giving us the read-through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that
you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little
deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that segment as
well?

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.                                                                                                                                                                           A
Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our
portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so-called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majority of our overall
portfolio is multi-family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we
like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to
what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don't see that as
sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader read-across.

Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a
year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your
unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months
from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we
expected a year ago?

conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more
about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that
there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing,
immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that
we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably
over-earning on credit a little bit.

Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some
surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there
should be some significant normalization.

Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have
to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the
outcome. We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if
we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the headwinds are
substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of
governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if those things
could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best.

He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else
equal, higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens
on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you like one immaterial and
insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently
written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really cares. But it's just one
example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and
responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix.

There are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering-on of the
operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't come through, you're
once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners. So we'll see, we'll see what happens.

I would just add to that. Even if your product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. You're going to manage by
product, by client, and by effectively business mix, and those need adjustments. Roughly, loans don't make sense to put on your balance
sheet as a whole, almost any loan, and people have to recognize that. And so we just manage through all the various complications here and
figure out what the hell to do.

Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you and perhaps
others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply
removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all-time stock price high at the same week
of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed?

Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power
and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right returns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how
that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not successful, then in some
cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that
those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those people are clients
and I think that point was addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has
had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.

Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not
pan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII between this quarter
and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if
you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more
revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not?

Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle
spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating
power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both
when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or
not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see
that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far.

But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of
them don't.

And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying
don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself
against the low-cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you're
getting closer?

Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly on benchmarking
ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that
we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we
respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI
and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot. So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is
room for improvement.

Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that
recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations
you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance really begins to
ramp in earnest.

Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a
function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our
kind of end-of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to
re-assert itself from this higher starting point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for
offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so
there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have
compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, our core view
remains modest deposit declines across the franchise.

Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effect, and you've
seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far,
with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it
than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better
when you've got ample supply of short-dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is
going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.

Helpful color, and just a follow-up on Card income. Revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of
pressure. Maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors.

Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one-off thing. So we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter, kind of
a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive one-off item
in the prior period. And obviously, I know you guys looked at it, but Card income isn't sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves.

Why don't you get Mikael to give that to you? It's not that significant but it's enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit wonky.

Thank you. Just want to follow-up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability
to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the
institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater
ability and willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material –
what are the real-world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulatory changes?
Thanks a lot.

Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different
banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product-specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the
overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it
puts pressure on returns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the
real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly since we don't actually
have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?

Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow-up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment-grade
lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you talked about the downside
– or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortgage credit asset-backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking
system?

I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when
home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces bad
outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially,
we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually
been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin-margin
business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas
where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago.

And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the
perimeter.

I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity
going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.

Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of
sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII
trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle,
we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit
repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from
minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like
$2.5 billion.

All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is
always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy.

Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward
guide here, longer-term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I
should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm
just trying to put those two things together.

Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the-
cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case
because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward
curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous,
and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta
for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.

Right. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of the outlook for NII
longer-term to normalize in the mid-70s. Is that right?

Yeah. I mean, basically, yes. If you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be 30 to 40 to 50 bps, I mean, whatever the product is,
yeah, that's the lag. And the $2.5 billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up. If rates don't actually go up,
that $2.5 billion may be exactly $2.5 billion again.

Yeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significantly lower number
contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product-level reprice. And
furthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate
Wholesale to Consumer.

Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what would make you
change your rates meaningfully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan-to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook
for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's what we've seen
historically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't need to pay that
much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?

Yeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead.

I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also
by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate
products, so it's a combination of all those things. I wouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports
who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given. I think it's a mistake.
There is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we've
ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And rates go up through
migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of
our business, and not in other parts.

Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans-to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let
deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade-off that eventually
you'll...

But that's a little more complicated because a lot of that loan-to-value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, etcetera.

Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration, or I shouldn't
say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republic primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want
to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium
event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first question. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?

Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.                                                                                                                                                                           A
Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah, we think about half
of the change in the bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system-wide
deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I think that the
replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project trends forward, that's a
different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products
and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.

And I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get
down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is
slightly something different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight if we
wanted to.

All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter
of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least
one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point

drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms
of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.

Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I
think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the
dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a
consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether
it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of
deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we
expect that trajectory to be.
