broad-based growth at Optum and UnitedHealthcare.

need, we are well-positioned to help even more people and continue to generate strong, diversified
growth in the coming years,” said Andrew Witty, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.

from operations were $8.5 billion, an increase of 14%.

2022. Favorable medical reserve development of $720 million compared to $480 million in the

growth, offset in part by productivity improvements.

Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted cash flows from operations are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as
a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying
business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of
acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion
provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue
generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.
Management believes the use of adjusted cash flows from operations provides investors and management with useful information to compare our cash flows from operations for the
current period to other periods, when the Company does not receive its monthly payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the applicable quarter. CMS
generally remits their monthly payments on the first calendar day of the applicable month. However, if the first calendar day of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, CMS has typically
paid the Company on the last business day of the preceding calendar month. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities presents operating cash flows assuming all CMS payments
were received on the first calendar day of the applicable month.
