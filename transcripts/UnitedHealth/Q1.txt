(a)        Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted cash flows from operations are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in
           addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
           Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the
           Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful
           information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s
           acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from
           period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related
           revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.
           Management believes the use of adjusted cash flows from operations provides investors and management with useful information to compare our cash flows from
           operations for the current period to other periods, when the Company does not receive its monthly payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
           (CMS) in the applicable quarter. CMS generally remits their monthly payments on the first calendar day of the applicable month. However, if the first calendar day of
           the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, CMS has typically paid the Company on the last business day of the preceding calendar month. Adjusted cash flows from
           operating activities presents operating cash flows assuming all CMS payments were received on the first calendar day of the applicable month.
