    invest to support growth.

•   The second quarter 2023 operating cost ratio of 14.9% increased from 14.6% last year due to
    business mix and the company’s continued investments to accelerate and support future
    opportunities, partially offset by continued productivity improvements.

•   Cash flows from operations for the second quarter 2023 were $11.0 billion or 2-times net
    income and $10.4 billion or 1.8-times net income adjusted for CMS payment timing. The
    company returned $4.8 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and
    share repurchases and increased its annual dividend rate by 14% in June. Return on equity of
    26.8% in the quarter reflected the company’s consistent, broad-based earnings profile and
    efficient capital structure.

           investments in services provided to patients and customers to support growth.

       •   Optum Health revenue per consumer served increased 33% over last year, driven by growth of
           more than 900,000 patients served under value-based care arrangements and the continued

           and expanding upon offerings to meet the increasing needs of care providers and health plans.

(a)        Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted cash flows from operations are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as
           a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
           Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying
           business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of
           acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion
           provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue
           generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.
           Management believes the use of adjusted cash flows from operations provides investors and management with useful information to compare our cash flows from operations for the
           current period to other periods, when the Company does not receive its monthly payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the applicable quarter. CMS
           generally remits their monthly payments on the first calendar day of the applicable month. However, if the first calendar day of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, CMS has typically
           paid the Company on the last business day of the preceding calendar month. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities presents operating cash flows assuming all CMS payments
           were received on the first calendar day of the applicable month.
